                    <b>Sooda</b> (Simple Object-Oriented Data Access) is an Object-To-Relational Mapping 
                    software for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/net">.NET</a> environment.
                    O/R Mapping Software enables you to express your business rules without using SQL at all.

                    Sooda is a code generator, which can to generate entire Data Access Layer for your application.
                    Each class that's generated as part of the DAL typically corresponds to a database table,
                    its properties map to database columns and relationships map to object references and collections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sooda supports the following features, which are explained in the following sections:

                <title>Mapping Tables to Classes</title>
                <body>
                    <p>
                        Most applications written in high-level languages use the object-oriented 
                        approach. It is incompatible with the relational(tabular) model used in the databases 
                        and mapping from tables to objects is required. 
                        Traditionally programmers have written their own data access layers 
                        (DALs) which encapsulated the details of the underlying database and table-to-class mapping
                        and provided object-oriented interface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal of the mapping is to store the values of object properties in the appropriate
                        columns of database tables. Assuming your object's properties are all primitive values
                        (such as integers, strings, date/time, booleans) we could provide a "natural" mapping
                        where:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>each object is stored in a single row in a particular table</li>
                        <li>each property is stored in a single column</li>
                        <li>the type of the column reflects the type of the property</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Assuming we have the following database table:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="SQL">
                        create table Customer
                        (
                            ID int primary key not null,
                            Name varchar(64),
                            Salary decimal,
                            HireDate datetime,
                            Active bit
                        );
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        The natural mapping turns it into a class which implements the following interface:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#">
                        class Person
                        {
                            int ID { get; set; }
                            string Name { get; set; }
                            decimal Salary { get; set; }
                            DateTime HireDate { get; set; }
                            bool Active { get; set; }
                        }
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Natural mapping is not always possible/desirable and therefore we need a <a href="#schema">mapping schema</a> to
                        fully describe the mapping for tables/columns/datatypes and more. We can for example:
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>use other name for database table (for example TblPerson instead of Person). 
                                There are some reserved SQL keywords which cannot be used as table names (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP)</li>
                            <li>use other names for database columns (for example hire_date instead of HireDate). Some databases have limitations on the
                            maximum column names so you might want to make them shorter.</li>
                            <li>use other datatypes (such as a column of type "integer" instead of "bit" to store the 
                                value of the "Active" property where "true" is represented by 1 and "false" is represented by 0)</li>
                        </ul>
                </body>
            </section>
            <section id="primarykeys">
                <title>Primary Keys and Object Identity</title>
                <body>
                    <p>
                        The identity of entities in the database is established by their primary keys. In object-oriented
                        languages we refer to objects by using their references. The references are
                        short-lived and are usually valid only for a single execution of the program and as such
                        they cannot be stored in a database directly, so the O/R mapper needs to convert
                        between primary/foreign key values and object references when loading or storing the data.</p>
                    <p>
                        This implies that in order to participate in O/R mapping
                        each database table needs to have one or more primary key columns (either natural or surrogate)
                        and you need to tell the mapper which columns are primary keys. The primary keys
                        must be properly maintained in the database (the best way is to create a UNIQUE index on primary
                        key columns). If you fail to do so (for example when there are many rows sharing the same
                        value in the primary key column), you may get all sorts of undefined behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sooda provides reference identity guarantee for objects retrieved from the database. That means
                        that if we make 2 or more  queries which retrieve a particular row from the 
                        database in the same <a href="#transactions">transaction</a>
                        they are guaranteed to be be mapped to the same object so 
                        <code lang="C#">
                            Object.ReferenceEquals(o1, o2) == true
                        </code>
                        There are other O/R Mapping products which only guarantee object value equality, so the same
                        row retrieved from the database in multiple queries can be mapped to more than
                        one row, so you only get:
                        <code lang="C#">
                            o1.Equals(o2)
                            o2.Equals(o1)
                        </code>
                        but
                        <code lang="C#">
                            Object.ReferenceEquals(o1, o2) == false
                        </code>
                    </p>

                <title>One-To-Many Relationships</title>
                <body>
                    One-to-many relationalships are typically represented as collections of objects related
                    to some particular object (only one). Typical examples are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>customer has a collection of orders (each order has exactly one customer)</li>
                        <li>group has members (each member belongs to exactly one group)</li>
                        <li>mother has children (each child has exactly one mother)</li>
                    </ul>
                    In databases we usually represent relationships as foreign key columns stored in the
                    "child" objects, so to represent the customer-to-orders relatioship we have a foreign
                    key column (perhaps called "customer") stored in the "Order" table. The value stored
                    in this column must match the primary key value of the Customer. The following
                    piece of SQL code demonstrates this:
                    <code lang="SQL">
                        <![CDATA[
                        create table Customer
                        (
                            ID int primary key not null,
                            Name varchar(64)
                            -- more columns here
                        );

                        create table Order
                        (
                            ID int primary key not null,
                            -- more columns here
                            Customer int not null references Customer(ID)
                        );
                        ]]>
                    </code>
                    Sooda makes the task of managing foreign key relationships rather simple by providing
                    a dual view of the relationship: reference from a "child" to its "parent" and a collection
                    of "children" that's a member of the "parent". Sooda can generate the following APIs:
                    <code lang="C#">
                        class Customer
                        {
                            int ID { get; set; }
                            string Name { get; set; }
                            ...
                            OrderList Orders { get; }
                        }

                        class Order
                        {
                            int ID { get; set; }
                            Customer Customer { get; set; }
                        }

                    In order to use Sooda in your project you need to have a working database. We'll be using Microsoft
                    SQL Server and the Northwind database. We'll also need to provide Sooda with the following information:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Mapping schema</b> that describes the mapping between tables/columns in your database and 
                        classes/properties. It is stored in an XML file, usually named <code>SoodaSchema.xml</code>.</li>
                    <li><b>Code generation parameters</b> which specify various aspects of code generation. 
                        The settings are stored in an XML file with <b>.soodaproject</b> extension.</li>
                    <li><b>Runtime configuration parameters</b> such as database connection string, connection type and SQL dialect - typically stored in your <code>Application.exe.config</code></li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    In addition, you need to make a small modification to your database (namely add a table that
                    will manage primary keys). The following sections will describe the required setup in detail.

        <body>
            <p>
                O/R Mapping Schema defines the mapping between CLI classes and database tables. You typically map
                each table in the database to a class, but you can also designate some table to be used for
                resolving the many-to-many relationship, specify that a class is to be based on multiple tables
                or describe a inheritance (<i>"is-a"</i>) relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
                The schema is contained in an XML file that is the input to <a href="#soodastubgen">SoodaStubGen</a> utility which
                generates class stubs. You can write the XML file by hand or you can use a tool, such as 
                <a href="#soodaschematool">SoodaSchemaTool</a> to generate it for you by reverse-engineering the database.
                Note that it's not possible to generate the mapping schema in a automated manner, because there are 
                things that simply aren't stored in the database, but the tools can give you a good approximation of the actual schema.

                <p>
                    Data Sources are defined with the <x><datasource /></x> element. A data source represents a 
                    connection to the database (or other store) where entities are stored. Each data source has a name and type. 
                    Sooda currently supports only <a href="#sqldatasource">Sql Data Source</a>, but
                    it is (theoretically) possible to add more data source types. Unless specified otherwise, the 
                    default data source for a class or relation is "<code>default</code>", which you need to have defined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until Sooda supports other data source types, the typical declaration that should occur at the beginning of each
                    mapping schema is:

                <p>
                    You can define additional SQL-based data sources for example to connect to multiple databases at once. Sooda
                    will keep a single connection to each data source, but won't create one until you use an object that's based on
                    the data source.

                    <x><table /></x> elements are used to define the mapping from database tables to classes and relations. Each

                    elements which represent columns in a database and properties in C#/VB. Each table must have at least one
                    field which is marked as primary key. It can have more than one (they are then called compound primary keys),

                    Objects may need to be stored in multiple tables for efficiency reasons. In the following example we have
                    two tables - one has person's ID, Name and Location, the other holds her PictureBlob (potentially very large piece of
                    binary data that encodes the person's photo). By storing the picture in a separate table we can avoid reading
                    from it until the data is actually needed.

                    Each <x><table /></x> is a unit for 
                    the load operation, which means whenever you access
                    one field from a table, the entire table gets loaded and is cached for further accesses. This is easy way 
                    to implement fine-grained lazy loading by splitting your fields in groups that are always accessed together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can even have two <x><table /></x> elements that are bound to the same physical database table. You only need to repeat
                    the primary key field in each <x><table /></x>. This allows for column-based lazy loading without the need to create
                    additional database tables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have 4 objects: Adam (with primary key 1), Eva (with primary key 2), 
                    Mary (with primary key 3), John (with primary key 4). Let's assume they are represented by the 
                    corresponding variable names and see how lazy loading works as we access their properties and
                    display them.

                    There's no support for compound properties (that would
                    map to more than one field), but it's relatively easy to do it by hand by adding a new property of the
                    required type.
