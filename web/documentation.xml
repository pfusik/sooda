                    <b>Sooda</b> (Simple Object-Oriented Data Access) is an Object-To-Relational Mapping 
                    software for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/NET/">.NET</a> environment.
                    O/R Mapping Software enables you to express your business rules without SQL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sooda includes a code generator, which can generate entire Data Access Layer for your application.
                    Each class of the DAL typically corresponds to a database table,
                    its properties map to database columns and relationships map to object references and collections.

                        Sooda supports code generation using CodeDOM technology. In theory any language should be supported,
                        but some languages have problems with their CodeDOM providers or their compilers are buggy.
                        The following languages have been tested:

            <section id="mappingtablestoclasses">
                <title>Mapping Classes to Tables</title>
                <body>
                    <p>
                        Most applications written in high-level languages use the object-oriented 
                        approach and often they need to store data in relational databases.

                        Working with objects, we use method calls, properties
                        events, collections, inheritance, polymorphism, and so on, while working with relational data 
                        requires us to think in terms of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE SQL operations
                        on rectangular tables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Obviously the two models (object-oriented and relational) are not 
                        compatible. Sooda lets you bridge the gap by providing an object-oriented interface to the database so that
                        you can write code in your favourite high-level language without using SQL at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's see how objects can be stored in a database. Assuming we have a simple class named Employee.
                    </p>
                    <img src="doc0.gif" alt="Employee Class" />
                    <p>
                        Objects of this class can be persisted when we follow the rules of so called "natural mapping", where:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>each object is stored in a single row of a single table whose name matches the name of the class</li>
                        <li>each property is stored in a single column, whose name matches the name of the property/field</li>
                        <li>the type of the column corresponds to the type of the property</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Applying these "natural mapping" rules to the Employee class, we get the following table:
                    </p>
                    <img src="doc1.gif" alt="Employee Table" />
                    <p>
                        Natural mapping as described above is not always possible/desirable and therefore we need a <a href="#schema">mapping schema</a> to
                        fully describe the mapping for tables/columns/datatypes and more. We can for example:
                        </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>override database table name (for example TblEmployee instead of Employee). 
                            There are some reserved SQL keywords which cannot be used as table names (<code>SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP</code>)</li>
                        <li>define names of database columns (for example hire_date instead of HireDate). Some databases 
                            impose limitations on the
                            maximum column names so you might want to make them shorter.</li>
                        <li>use other datatypes (such as a column of type "integer" instead of "bit" to store the 
                            value of the "Active" property with "true" and "false" mapped to "1" and "0" respectively)</li>
                        <li>objects may need to be persisted in <a href="#mappingmultipletablestoclasses">more than one table</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </body>
            </section>
            <section id="primarykeys">
                <title>Primary Keys and Object Identity</title>
                <body>
                    <p>
                        Entities in the databases are identified by their primary keys. In object-oriented
                        languages we refer to objects by their references. The references are
                        valid only for a single execution of the program and cannot be stored in a database directly.
                        O/R mapper needs to convert between primary key values and object references 
                        when loading and storing data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to participate in O/R mapping each database table needs to have one or more primary key 
                        columns (either natural or surrogate) and you need to tell the mapper which columns are primary keys. 
                        The primary keys must be properly maintained in the database (the best way is to create a UNIQUE index on primary
                        key columns). If you fail to do so (for example when there are many rows sharing the same
                        value in the primary key column), you may get all sorts of undefined behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each object in Sooda knows about the primary key that represents it in the database.
                        <a href="#objectidentity">Transaction-level object cache</a> (L1 cache) is used to map primary keys to objects.
                        This two-way mapping lets Sooda provide <a href="#objectidentity">reference identity</a> for objects
                        it manages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When creating a new object in memory, the primary key needs to be known in advance (before
                        the object is actually stored in the database). Because of this, we cannot use identity columns in
                        databases to provide primary keys, other mechanism to generate primary keys is necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sooda provides <a href="#keygeneration">key generators</a> which may be used for this purpose.
                        The default one uses a special table in the database to manage batched key allocation. Alternatively, for primary
                        keys which are GUIDs, you can use the standard Guid.NewGuid() generation method.
                    </p>

            </section>
            <section id="mappingonetomany">
                <title>One-To-Many Relationships</title>
                <body>
                    One-to-many relationships are typically represented as collections of objects related
                    to some particular object (only one). Typical examples are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>customer has a collection of orders (each order has exactly one customer)</li>
                        <li>group has members (each member belongs to exactly one group)</li>
                        <li>mother has children (each child has exactly one mother)</li>
                    </ul>
                    In databases we usually represent relationships as foreign key columns stored in the
                    "child" objects, so to represent the customer-to-orders relationship we have a foreign
                    key column (perhaps named "customer") stored in the "Order" table. The value stored
                    in this column must match the primary key value of the Customer. 
                    
                    The following piece of SQL code demonstrates this for a simple Customer to Order relationship:

                    <code lang="SQL">
                        <![CDATA[
create table Customer
(
    ID int primary key not null,
    Name varchar(64),
    Address1 varchar(64),
    Address2 varchar(64)
);

create table Order
(
    ID int primary key not null,
    -- more columns here
    CustomerID int not null references Customer(ID)
);
                        ]]>
                    </code>

                    <img src="doc2.gif" alt="One-To-Many relationship between Customer and Order" />
                    <p>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sooda makes the task of managing foreign key relationships rather simple by providing
                        a dual view of the relationship: reference from a "child" to its "parent" and a collection
                        of "children" that is a member of the "parent" objects. You only need to specify which property in the
                        "child" object is a reference to the "parent" object. Code generated by Sooda includes the following APIs:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#">
class Customer
{
    int ID { get; set; }
    string Name { get; set; }
    ...
    OrderList Orders { get; }
}

class Order
{
    int ID { get; set; }
    Customer Customer { get; set; }
}
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        The OrderList is functionally equivalent to IList&lt;Order&gt; with some filtering
                        and sorting methods <a href="#generatedlistwrappers">included for convenience</a>. Customer is
                        a reference to the Customer class. Sooda lets you write:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#">
Customer c;

// create new order
Order o = new Order()
c.Orders.Add(o);
// this is equivalent to the above
o.Customer = c; 
c.Orders.Remove(o);
// get order count
c.Orders.Count; 
// check it the orders contains the specified one
c.Orders.Contains(o); 
// return a sorted collection
c.Orders.OrderBy(sortExpression); 

                    </code>
                    <p>
                       Convenience methods of Sooda collections are described <sectionlink id="generatedlistwrappers" />.

                    <p>
                        Many-to-many relationships are used in many situations, such as these:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>person-to-permission (each person has many permissions, each permission is held by many persons)</li>
                        <li>lecture-to-student (each student attends many lectures, each lecture is attended by many students)</li>
                        <li>and so on</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Database representation of many-to-many relationships requires a separate table that will
                        hold pairs of primary keys that are in relationship, such as the Employee2Permission table in the following
                        figure:

                        Sooda generates a pair of collection which provide access to objects in the relationship. In this example, we have:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#">
class Employee
{
    ...
    PermissionList Permissions { get; }
}

class Permission
{
    ...
    EmployeeList Employees { get; }
}

                    <p>
                        These collections support the same set of operations as one-to-many collections, namely Add(), Remove(), 
                        Contains(), Count and others. The collections are synchronized, no matter which object you
                        use to modify the relationships, the result is the same. In this example you could:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>add a Permission to a collection of permissions held by Employee</li>
                        <li>add an Employee to a collection of employees which hold the permission</li>

                    <p>
                        Often you need to operate on an object but you do not need access to its properties.
                        It would be very inefficient to load full record from a database each time
                        a reference to it is needed. For example you do not need to know the name of the employee
                        just to check if he is in relationship with some other objects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sooda supports lazy loading by maintaining a data structure that holds object data. It 
                        loads the data and initializes the data structures on as-needed basis, which means objects do not allocate 
                        memory for their data values until the properties are accessed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each object managed by Sooda can be in one of the four states:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Data Not Loaded</b> - no properties have been accessed</li>
                        <li><b>Data Loaded</b> - some properties have been read</li>
                        <li><b>Data Not Loaded - Modified</b> - some properties have been written to, but not read from</li>
                        <li><b>Data Loaded - Modified</b> - some properties have been written to, and some have been read from</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="doc4.png" alt="Possible lazy loading states of an object" />
                    <p>
                        Each time a property is read in <b>Data Not Loaded</b> or <b>Data Not Loaded-Modified</b> state
                        Sooda needs to access the database to load the data. If a property is only written to, there is no need
                        to even load the data from the database.

                        Objects in memory may form graphs: they may include properties which are

                    <p>
                        You can access collections in the same manner:

                    <code lang="C#">
                        // display the number of org unit members

                <title>Mapping Multiple Tables to a Single Class</title>
                <body>
                    <p>
                        A class can be mapped to more than one table in the database or it can be split into many logical "tables" which
                        are actually mapped to the same physical table. We may want to do it for many reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>database engine limitations - some databases have maximum row size limit, and you may not be able to store
                            long texts in a single table because of this limit. Splitting table in two and performing joins by primary key
                            may be the only option</li>
                        <li>performance - imagine you have some large field which you access infrequently (such as a person's picture). 
                            Loading the field from the database would not be efficient because it would consume time and memory.
                            Lazy loading mechanism works on a table level which means that it loads the entire row from a table each
                            time a single column is accessed. Putting the large column in a separate table helps remediate this issue.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This is the most typical situation where some columns may be placed in a separate table for performance:</p>
                    <img src="doc5.gif" alt="Large columns moved to a separate table" />
                    <p>If the data row size is not a problem, we may still want to do the logical partitioning of data while
                        keeping them in a single table. We only need to tell Sooda to keep some fields together by grouping them in
                        a logical Table.</p>
                    <p>
                        The following example shows the Employee table which contains two large columns which we want to load separately: 
                        Picture which is an image and VoiceSample which is a blob. Possible partitions of this table are marked with
                        separate colors. Note that the primary key column is not marked because it is always present in memory and
                        does not need to be loaded at all.
                    </p>
                    <img src="doc6.gif" alt="Grouping large columns for lazy loading"/>
                    <p>
                        Sooda makes it possible to create a class based on up to 32 physical or logical tables. The only thing they
                        need to have in common is their primary key. This feature is used in inheritance, which is described <sectionlink id="inheritance" />.

                    <p>
                        Inheritance ("is-a" relationship) is an object-oriented programming concept which is not present in
                        relational databases. One of the most important features of inheritance is polymorphism (ability to
                        act on objects through their base classes or interfaces without knowing their exact type).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inheriting classes may introduce additional fields (properties) and we need a way to store them in a database.
                        There are 3 methods of storing inheritance hierarchy in database:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>TPT</b> or <b>TPS</b>- table per type (or table per subclass) - each class that adds member fields stores them in a separate table</li>
                        <li><b>TPH</b> - table per hierarchy - fields for all classes in the inheritance hierarchy are stored in a single table</li>
                        <li><b>TPC</b> - table per concrete type - each concrete type (non-abstract class) is kept in its own table.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Assuming you have a simple hierarchy of 4 classes:
                    </p>
                    <img src="doc8.gif" alt="Hierarchy of classes" />
                    <p>
                        The TPT representation of this hierarchy looks like this (note that each subclass is stored in its own table,
                        and only the fields added in that subclass are kept there, the other fields are accessible through primary key join):
                    </p>
                    <img src="doc7.gif" alt="TPT(TPS) representation" />
                    <p>
                        TPH model (note that fields from all classes are gathered in a single table and each field from a non-root class
                        is nullable):
                    </p>
                    <img src="doc9.gif" alt="TPH representation" />
                    <p>
                        Or a TPC model (fields from the base class are repeated in all tables):
                    </p>
                    <img src="doc10.gif" alt="TPC representation" />
                    <p>
                        Supporting polymorphism in O/R mapping requires the engine to be able to create instances
                        of the proper subclass on load. This is required because when you load an object from 
                        the database you may get an instance of a subclass.
                        Object references (stored as foreign keys) are also polymorphic (you only store the key value, not the 
                        concrete type). We need a way to be able to quickly determine the concrete class that will
                        represent the object from the database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        TPT and TPH storage models require a special column (called discriminator column) to select between subclasses. 
                        This column needs to provide a unique mapping between the concrete class and an integer value
                        (for example 1-QuestionWorkItem, 2-AnalysisWorkItem, 3-BugWorkItem). 
                        Each time an object of a particular class is persisted, a value corresponding to its class is stored in
                        this column and on load this value is used to recreate object of the proper class.
                        TPC model does not need this column but makes it more difficult to access objects in a polymorphic manner,
                        because you need to perform a UNION select or make multiple queries in order to fetch all objects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Polymorphic access enables you to write:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#">

                        Sooda supports TPT and TPH, but <b>does not support TPC model</b> because it is less efficient
                        than the other two and requires complex SQL queries to be generated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sooda extends the concept of "tables" on which each class is based to mean not only physical tables
                        but also vertical table partitions. This way you can create a mixture of TPT and TPH in your program.
                        For example you can store the hierarchy in TWO tables instead of one. You can also
                        store most commonly used subclasses in a single table but move rarely used or "heavy" data (such as blobs) 
                        to separate physical tables.

                        Frequent use of single rows from the database (which is common for all O/R mapping products) can be
                        expensive. The cost of an SQL server roundtrip can be quite high. Sooda implements in-memory caching of objects
                        retrieved from the SQL database (both single rows and collections) so that the speed of processing is improved.

            <p>
                Sooda comes with a graphical wizard that can be used to automatically add Sooda support to your Visual Studio project.
                In this tutorial we will use it to create a simple C# application that exercises various features of Sooda. We will be
                using the <code>Northwind</code> database that comes with MSSQL Server but any database should be ok.

            <title>Configuring Sooda project</title>
            <body>
                <p>
                    Let's start by creating an empty C# Console application project in Visual Studio. After the project has been created
                    and saved to disk (you need to save your projects explicitly when using Visual Studio Express Editions), run the wizard
                    by clicking on the "Add Sooda Support to Visual Studio Project" shortcut on the Start menu:
                </p>
                <img src="docwizardlaunch.gif" class="screenshot66" />
                <p>
                    The first step of the wizard is a greeting message that reminds the user to prepare a database 
                    and choose a Visual Studio project file to configure. Choose the project by clicking <code>Browse</code>.
                    We can proceed to the next step by clicking the <code>Next</code> button.
                </p>
                <img src="docwizard1.gif" class="screenshot66" />
                <p>
                    In the second step of the wizard you need to specify database server and credentials used to connect to the database.
                    Make sure the account used to connect has the right to create additional tables in the database or you will not be able
                    to complete the wizard (using a local administrator account and Windows Authentication should be sufficient in most cases).
                    Click <code>Next</code> to proceed to the database selection:
                </p>
                <img src="docwizard2.gif" class="screenshot66" />
                <p>
                    The third step of the wizard prompts you to choose one of the databases that are running on the server. Choose <code>Northwind</code> and click <code>Next</code>.
                </p>
                <img src="docwizard3.gif" class="screenshot66" />
                <p>
                    The last page of the wizard presents a list of actions the wizard can perform for you. The default set of options should
                    be just fine, and clicking <code>Finish</code> will add Sooda support to your project as requested.
                </p>
                <img src="docwizard4.gif" class="screenshot66" />
                <p>If you choose to set advanced options by clicking the <code>Advanced Options</code> button, the wizard will present
                    you with a list of more settings each followed by the <code>Explain</code> link that will direct you to the appropriate
                    section of the documentation.
                </p>
                <img src="docwizard4a.gif" class="screenshot66" />
                <p>
                    Once you have set up your project it is time to compile it. Switch to Visual Studio and click "Build" (note that you will
                    get warnings about project file modifications - choose to Reload your project when prompted).
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is possible that you get the following error when building your project.
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    error CS0234: The type or namespace name 'Drawing' does not exist in the namespace 'System' (are you missing an assembly reference?)
                </code>
                <p>
                    If you do, add 'System.Drawing.dll' reference to your project and recompile. This error may occur if you
                    use have any pictures stored in the database (which is the case with <code>Northwind</code> database).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note how the Wizard generated the following files for your project:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>projectname.soodaproject</code> - that stores <a href="#soodaproject">code generation settings</a></li>
                    <li><code>SoodaSchema.xml</code> - that contains the <a href="#schema">object-to-relational mapping schema</a></li>
                    <li><code>App.config</code> - that contains runtime configuration settings</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition to these your project has been modified to automatically launch the <a href="#soodastubgen">SoodaStubGen utility</a>
                    on each build and optionally to launch <a href="#soodacompilestubs">SoodaCompileStubs</a> to precompile stubs to a DLL.

        <section id="gettingstartedrenamingclasses">
            <title>Renaming classes</title>
            <body>
                <p>
                    Class names detected by the wizard are plural nouns, because this is how tables are named in the <code>Northwind</code>
                    database. For example we have <code>Territories</code> instead of <code>Territory</code>.
                    Using plurals in class names is not a good idea so we should fix it by renaming the classes.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    To do this, open <code>SoodaSchema.xml</code> and replace all plural class names with the appropriate singular forms.
                    Make sure to replace only class names not table names, so it is best to use the following renaming strategy:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>replace <code>"Territories"</code> with <code>"Territory"</code> (quotes should be included in the 
                        Search For and Replace With strings)</li>
                    <li>replace <code>&lt;table name="Territory" /&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;table name="Territories" /&gt;</code></li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Repeat the above steps to rename:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>Categories</code> with <code>Category</code></li>
                    <li><code>Customers</code> with <code>Customer</code></li>
                    <li><code>Employees</code> with <code>Employee</code></li>
                    <li><code>Orders</code> with <code>Order</code></li>
                    <li><code>Products</code> with <code>Product</code></li>
                    <li><code>Region</code> with <code>Region</code></li>
                    <li><code>Shippers</code> with <code>Shipper</code></li>
                    <li><code>Suppliers</code> with <code>Supplier</code></li>
                    <li><code>Territories</code> with <code>Territory</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition, you should give meaningful names to all collections declared with
                    <x><collectionOneToMany /></x> and <x><collectionManyToMany /></x>. You should
                    remove <code>CollectionOf</code> and trailing digits from the names.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remove the following files for classes that are no longer present 
                    or you will get errors about some non-existent stub classes.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Categories.cs</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    When you are done, rebuild your project.

            <title>Adding example code to your project</title>
            <body>
                <p>
                    It is now time to add some code to the project that will demonstrate the use of DAL classes generated by Sooda.
                    By default Sooda generates one class for each table found in the database and the name of the class corresponds to
                    the name of the table as described <sectionlink id="soodaschematoolgenschema" />.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you can use Sooda objects, you need to create an instance of <a href="#soodatransaction">SoodaTransaction</a> 
                    class. You can only access your objects within the transaction and after the transaction is closed, object references
                    are not valid. Typically you create a <code>SoodaTransaction</code> object in a <code>using()</code> clause.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To begin, add the following <code>using</code> clauses to the top of your <code>Program.cs</code> source file 
                    replacing <code>YOURNAMESPACE</code> with the namespace of the project:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    using Sooda;
                    using YOURNAMESPACE.TypedQueries;
                </code>
                <p>
                    Copy the following piece of code and paste it to replace the generated <code>Main()</code> method:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    public static void Main()
                    {
                        // you cannot access Sooda objects here

                        using (SoodaTransaction tran = new SoodaTransaction())
                        {
                            // access your objects here

                            // commit all changes made within transaction
                            tran.Commit();
                        }

                        // you cannot access Sooda objects here
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    We are now ready to test various Sooda features. Let's start with simple object loading. To load an object given its
                    primary key, you can use the generated <code>Load()</code> static method. The following code loads a row from the 
                    <code>Territories</code> table and displays its <code>TerritoryDescription</code>. Note that you use the 
                    (renamed) class names instead of the table names in your code.
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    Territory t = Territory.Load("98104");
                    Console.WriteLine("Territory is: {0}", t.TerritoryDescription);
                </code>
                <p>
                    When you run this program, it should display:
                </p>
                <pre class="csharp">Territory is: Seattle</pre>
                <p>
                    To see what region Seattle belongs to, we can use the <a href="#pathexpressions">path expression</a> <code>t.Region.RegionDescription</code>:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    Territory t = Territory.Load("98104");
                    Console.WriteLine("Territory is: {0}", t.TerritoryDescription);
                    Console.WriteLine("Region is: {0}", t.Region.RegionDescription);
                </code>
                <p>
                    We can use <code>foreach()</code> to enumerate all employees from Seattle:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    Territory t = Territory.Load("98104");

                    foreach (Employee e in t.Employees)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine("name: {0} {1} id: {2}", e.LastName, e.FirstName, e);
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    There is one: <code>Michael Suyama</code> and his Employee ID is <code>6</code>. 
                    Let's see a list of his all superiors:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    Employee michaelSuyama = Employee.Load(6);

                    for (Employee e = michaelSuyama; e != null; e = e.ReportsTo)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine("id={0} name={1} {2} reports to={3}", 
                             e.EmployeeID, e.LastName, e.FirstName, e.ReportsTo);
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    Running this code presents us with a list of 3 people and their IDs:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    id=6 name=Suyama Michael reports to=5
                    id=5 name=Buchanan Steven reports to=2
                    id=2 name=Fuller Andrew reports to=
                </code>
                <p>
                    What if we wanted to find people by their names?

                    LINQ and Typed Queries have the advantage of queries being validated at compile time.

                    of removing a field or changing its data type.

                    Creating and modifying objects is easy. To create objects you simply use the familiar <code>new</code> 
                    construct. To create new order you would write:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    Order o = new Order();
                </code>
                <p>
                    To modify objects, just set their appropriate properties:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    o.ShipCity = "Redmond";
                    o.ShipCountry = "US";
                    o.ShipPostalCode = "98052";
                    o.ShipAddress = "One Microsoft Way";

                    When you are done with object modifications, you can call the <code>Commit()</code> method on the transaction

                O/R Mapping Schema defines the mapping between CLI classes and database tables. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The schema is contained in an XML file that is the input to <a href="#soodastubgen">SoodaStubGen utility</a> which
                generates class stubs. You can write the XML file by hand or you can use a tool, such as 
                <a href="#soodaschematool">SoodaSchemaTool</a> to generate it for you by reverse-engineering the database.
                Note that it is not possible to generate the mapping schema in a fully automated manner. There are 
                things that simply cannot be retrieved from the database (such as inheritance relationships, named constants, many-to-many
                relationship names), anyway the tools can give you a good approximation of the actual schema.
            </p>
            <p>
                The root of the XML document is the <x><schema /></x> element with the appropriate XML namespace (<code>http://www.sooda.org/schemas/SoodaSchema.xsd</code>).
                Child elements of the <x><schema /></x> define classes, relations and so on, as described below.

                    Data Sources are defined with the <x><datasource /></x> element. A data source represents a 
                    connection to the database (or other store) where entities are stored. Each data source has a name and type. 
                    Sooda currently supports only <a href="#sqldatasource">Sql Data Source</a>, but
                    it is (theoretically) possible to add more data source types. Unless specified otherwise, the 
                    default data source for a class or relation is "<code>default</code>", which you need to have defined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Sooda supports no other data source types, the declaration that should be present at the beginning of each
                    mapping schema is:

                    You can define additional SQL-based data sources for example to connect to multiple databases at once. Sooda
                    will keep a single connection to each data source, but will not create one until you use an object that is based on
                    this data source.

                    In the following example we have two tables - one has employee ID, Name, Salary, HireDate and Active flag, 
                    the other stores his/her Picture (potentially very large piece of binary data that encodes the person's photo). 
                    By storing the picture in a separate table we can avoid reading from it until the data is actually needed.

                    Each <x><table /></x> is a unit for the load operation, which means whenever you access
                    one field from a table, the entire table row gets loaded and is cached for further accesses. This is easy way 
                    to implement fine-grained <a href="#lazyloading">lazy loading</a> by splitting your fields in groups that are always accessed together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is possible to have two <x><table /></x> elements that are bound to the same physical database table. You only need to repeat
                    the primary key field in each <x><table /></x> element. This allows for column-based lazy loading without the need to create
                    additional database tables. For example, the following Employee class uses mentioned partitioning feature
                    to avoid loading Picture and VoiceSample with other columns.

                    The <x><const /></x> element defines <a href="#generatedenums">named constants</a> to be generated. 
                    Each constant has a name and value, whose type depends on the primary key type of this class. Constants are
                    not supported for classes with compound primary keys or where the type of the primary key is other than Integer or
                    String.

                    Once you have defined the constants you may use them instead of calling classname.GetRef(). Note that you cannot
                    pass the instance of <a href="#soodatransaction">SoodaTransaction</a> so constants are limited to 
                    be used in the context of implicit transaction.

                    In short, it defines a collection named COLLECTION_NAME whose items are of class CHILD_CLASS where the value of
                    FOREIGN_FIELD equals to this object's primary key. In other words this is a list of objects referencing this object
                    through the specified reference field.

                <p>
                    Sooda also supports additional attribute named <code>where</code> which can be used to define where clause to
                    be used when fetching objects. This can be used to create filtered collections:

                    The above example defines two collections in the Group class: one named <code>Members</code> holds all members of
                    the group, the other is named <code>VipMembers</code> and holds only members who are VIPs.

                    <b>CAUTION:</b> Collections defined with "where" are not recommended because they do not automatically reflect
                    the state of child objects when you manually change the foreignField. Collections without where clause
                    do not exhibit this problem.

                    The <x><relation /></x> element defines a relation (table) that resolves many-to-many relationships.
                    It must include exactly two fields, which are references to other tables.

                    Each record in this table represents a relationships between two objects pointed at by the fields.
                    For example, assuming we have a relation Contact2Group with 2 columns: contact_id and group_id
                    and it contains a row where contact_id=1 and group_id=7 it means that contact[1] and group[7] are in
                    (some) relationship. The name of the relationship is established by <x><collectionManyToMany /></x>.

                    Schemas can include one another. This is a way to split complex domain models into many manageable files
                    which are subject to separate compilation and code generation.

                <p>
                    You need to use the <x><include /></x> to include another schema. The following attributes are supported
                    (attributes marked with bold are required).

                                        Specifies the name of the subclass selector field that determines this object type. The
                                        field must be defined in this <x><class /></x>, in the first <x><table /></x> and must
                                        be either integer or string. Based on the value stored in this field Sooda is
                                        able to instantiate objects of the appropriate class in a polymorphic manner.
                                        Values stored in this field correspond to concrete (non-abstract) classes and are defined
                                        using <code>subclassSelectorValue</code>. See examples below.

                                        The class that defines subclassSelectorField is named the root of inheritance hierarchy.
                                        You cannot put subclassSelectorField in any class that inherits from another class 
                                        (to form sub-hierarchies). This feature might be added in future versions of Sooda.

                                    or inherit (directly or indirectly) from such a class. It is an error to inherit from a class
                                    that does not ultimately derive from a root class (that has <code>subclassSelectorField</code> defined).

                                        Specifies the value of the subclass selector field that determines this object type. This parameter
                                        must be is specified for each concrete (non-abstract) class in the inheritance hierarchy.
                                        Sooda will instantiate objects of the appropriate type based on a value of the subclassSelectorField.
                                        If the value is equal to subclassSelectorValue for a particular class, an instance of this
                                        class will be created to represent the object.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you do not specify the value for subclassSelectorValue, <a href="#soodaschematool">SoodaStubGen</a>
                                        will generate an abstract class that cannot be instantiated programmatically.

                                        Values provided in subclassSelectorValue are also used in polymorphic queries to
                                        limit the selected objects to instances of a particular class. For example if you
                                        get a list of objects of a particular class you may get objects of this class (provided that they are
                                        not abstract) and all non-abstract classes that derive from it, either directly or indirectly.

                    Sooda supports two models of inheritance mapping: table-per-hierarchy (TPH) and table-per-subclass (TPS) as described <sectionlink id="inheritance" />.
                    They only differ in actual table names used to store fields in subclasses, so the configuration is similar. Assuming
                    the familiar table of WorkItems structure we can map it to classes using the provided schema:

                    The mapping in TPH model is very similar. You only need to change the table names, so
                    that they are all "TPH_WorkItem". We will also rename fields by prefixing them with acronyms
                    of concrete subclasses they belong to:

            <body>
                <p>
                    There are situations where Sooda needs to temporarily store an object in a database but the state of the object
                    prevents it from being able to do so. Typically this is because of a not-nullable column requiring a value that
                    has not been defined and we are executing a query that may potentially return the object. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To overcome this issue, Sooda supports a mechanism of precommit values, which can be used instead of real values
                    just to make the object "save-able". There are 3 levels of precommit values:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>per-datatype precommit value</b> - you can decide the value for each data type. For example you 
                        want to store -1 for all not-null integer fields or 2000-01-01 00:00:00 for all DateTime fields</li>
                    <li><b>per-class precommit value</b> - this is used whenever you store a foreign key (which persists a reference to
                        a class). You can specify that unspecified foreign keys to some particular class should be persisted as
                        a specified numeric or string value</li>
                    <li><b>per-field precommit value</b> - to be used for a particular field.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Rules of precommit are described <sectionlink id="precommit" />.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use <x><precommitValue /></x> elements in your schema to define <b>per-datatype precommit value</b>. This example
                    defines a precommit value of -1 for Integer fields, <i>***NONE***</i> string for all String fields and <i>***NOTHING***</i>
                    for all AnsiString fields. You should pick a value that you do not commonly search for in your queries.

                <p>
                    In order to define <b>per-class precommit value</b>, you use the defaultPrecommitValue on a class.
                    Typically you use this feature when your database uses foreign key constraints and defaultPrecommitValue
                    is a value of an object that is known to exist in the table.

                    Setting per-field precommit value has the highest precedence. If you do not
                    provide it and the field is a reference field, the defaultPrecommitValue for the
                    referenced class is used. It that still does not lead to a usable precommit value,
                    Sooda uses the per-type default precommit value and if it is not defined, 
                    the default "zero" value is used based on the datatype:

                    Sooda provides a utility called <a href="#soodastubgen">SoodaStubGen</a> that generates stub source code for 
                    the Data Access Layer. The generated source code needs to be compiled with a standard C#/VB compiler to 
                    produce a working assembly. This section describes the compilation process in detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is recommended to run SoodaStubGen as part of your (preferably fully automated and repeatable) build process so Sooda supports 
                    calling stub generator from a batch file, NAnt script or Visual Studio 2003/2005/2008/2010 solution 
                    (Visual Studio 2002 is not supported).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sooda supports two compilation modes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#compilationprocessstandard">Standard Stub Compilation</a> - stubs and business classes are compiled together in a single compiler pass. 
                        This should be compatible with most languages and compilers, but can be slow for really large schemas (which generate huge stub classes). This mode also
                        causes Visual Studio to slow down.
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="#compilationprocessseparate">Separate Stub Compilation</a> - enables stubs to be precompiled to a separate *.dll,
                        which speeds up large builds but has some drawbacks which are described below.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Separate compilation of stubs is difficult because of cyclic dependency between stub classes and skeleton
                    classes, which exists because:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>skeleton classes must <b>inherit</b> from stub classes</li>
                    <li>stub classes must <b>return references</b> to skeleton classes.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The following figure describes the problem. Note how Book_Stub class must be able to return references
                    to Person class and Person_Stub must be able to return Book objects. At the same time Book inherits
                    from Book_Stub and Person inherits from Person_Stub:

                <p style="color: red">
                    <b>CAUTION</b> Separate Stub Compilation relies on the ability of C# compiler to compile DLLs which
                    reference each other (cyclic dependencies). SoodaCompileStubs is used to ensure the proper bootstrapping
                    of such inter-dependent DLLs. Microsoft C# compiler (v1.1 and v2.0) is supported
                    but Mono Project Compiler (mcs) is not because it is unable to properly handle cyclic references.

                    <ol>
                        <li>SoodaStubGen produces two files:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>_Stubs.cs</b> (the extension is different for other languages) - stub source file</li>

                            </ul>
                            It also generates one "skeleton" file for each <a href="#schemaclasses">class</a> defined in schema.
                            The files are named <code>ClassName.cs</code> where ClassName is the name of the class.
                            <b>The skeleton is only generated in the first run and is never automatically regenerated</b>
                            You can add your own properties and business methods in the skeleton and your changes will be preserved
                            when rebuilding project. "Skeleton" inherits from a "stub" class so you get access to all its
                            properties and methods.

                        Separate Stub Compilation is a process in which you precompile stubs to a separate DLL and
                        rebuild the DLL only when the schema changes. This can save compile time for very large schemas
                        and can also make Visual Studio run faster (for some reason Visual Studio 2005 does not perform very
                        well on very large source files which SoodaStubGen creates).

                        Automating Visual Studio builds using Sooda relies on the <code>Pre-Build Event</code> setting which invokes
                        <a href="#soodastubgen">SoodaStubGen.exe</a> and optionally <a href="#soodacompilestubs">SoodaCompileStubs.exe</a>.
                        It is possible to pass arbitrary command-line arguments to these commands, but it is recommended to use 
                        <a href="#soodaproject">Sooda Project Files</a> which make this process a simpler to manage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To set the Pre-Build Event command line, open project properties in Visual Studio and locate "<code>Build Events</code>".
                        Recommended Pre-Build Event command line is (for .NET 1.1/Visual Studio 2003)

                    <p>
                        SOODA_DIR environment variable must be set properly (it is automatically initialized by the installer). You may want to adjust
                        the path if you installed Sooda manually in some other location.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visual Studio 2002 does not support Pre-build Events and therefore cannot invoke SoodaStubGen automatically.

                    Sooda Project Files are used to control the generation of stub source code with the <a href="#soodastubgen">SoodaStubGen utility</a>. 
                    Project files are easier to read and maintain than command-line arguments passed to SoodaStubGen.
                    Visual Studio supports Intellisense so editing them is easy, even without documentation.

                <p>
                    Sooda Project file must be saved in a file with <code>*.soodaproject</code> extension.
                    It is an XML file, whose root element is <x><sooda-project /></x> and its
                    XML Namespace is <code>http://www.sooda.org/schemas/SoodaProject.xsd</code>

                <p>
                    Sooda configuration files are usually managed by the .NET configuration mechanism and the parameters
                    are stored in application configuration files (<code>App.config</code>) as described <sectionlink id="configurationappconfig" />.
                    If you have many programs that share runtime configuration, Sooda can be configured from a
                    shared XML configuration file. This feature is described <sectionlink id="configurationxml" />.
                    If you have developed your own configuration mechanism, you can write a specialized Sooda 
                    configuration provider for it as described <sectionlink id="configurationcustom" />.

                    <p>
                        By default Sooda configuration parameters are stored in standard .NET configuration files named
                        <code>ApplicationName.exe.config</code> or <code>Web.config</code> in a section named <x><appSettings /></x>. 
                        More information about .NET Configuration files is available in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1fk1t1t0.aspx">MSDN Library</a>.

                        Each data source configuration entry has a form:

                    <p>
                        <code>dataSourceName</code> is the name of the datasource (usually "<code>default</code>") and <code>parameterName</code> 
                        is the name of the setting for that datasource. The value of the setting is stored in <code>parameterName</code>.
                        Possible setting names are described <sectionlink id="configuringdatasources" />.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some global options can also be set this way. Global options use the "<code>sooda</code>" prefix instead of a data source name.
                        They are described <sectionlink id="configurationglobal" />.

                    <p>
                        There are situations where multiple applications need to share the same set of configuration parameters.
                        Instead of keeping multiple copies of Sooda-specific configuration, you can store the settings in
                        a single XML file which is read by the applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The format of the file is very simple. Each parameter is enclosed in an XML element and nesting is used to
                        group parameters for a single datasource. The root element of the configuration file is not important,
                        which means you can embed the Sooda-specific XML elements in any XML file as long as you can
                        add your own elements.

                        The following example demonstrates XML configuration file equivalent to the App.config 
                        shown above.

                        XML config files also support per-host overrides. Assuming the configuration file is 
                        read from <code>sooda.config.xml</code>, Sooda looks for <code>sooda.config.HOSTNAME.xml</code> 
                        where <code>HOSTNAME</code> is the name of the machine the application is running on. If the 
                        host-specific configuration file is found, Sooda reads it as well and any settings specified in this
                        file take precedence over the common configuration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sooda looks for an XML configuration file in the application base directory. If the file is not found
                        the parent directory is scanned, then its grandparent and so on until the file is found or until
                        ten levels of directory hierarchy have been scanned or the root directory has been reached. 
                        Assuming that your application is stored in <code>c:\myprojects\mysystem1\app1\bin\Debug\app.exe</code>
                        and the name of the configuration file is: <code>sooda.config.xml</code>, 
                        and Sooda will look for it in the following locations:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>c:\myprojects\mysystem1\app1\bin\Debug\sooda.config.xml</li>
                        <li>c:\myprojects\mysystem1\app1\bin\sooda.config.xml</li>
                        <li>c:\myprojects\mysystem1\app1\sooda.config.xml</li>
                        <li>c:\myprojects\mysystem1\sooda.config.xml</li>
                        <li>c:\myprojects\sooda.config.xml</li>
                        <li>c:\sooda.config.xml</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        As you can see, this is convenient because you can keep the settings for all applications making up
                        entire system in a single file (<code>c:\myprojects\mysystem1\sooda.config.xml</code>) and
                        all applications will be able to read it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To use XML configuration files, add this line of code to the <code>AssemblyInfo.cs</code>

                    <p>
                        If you have developed your own configuration mechanism, you can get Sooda to use it by creating a class
                        that implements the <code>Sooda.Config.ISoodaConfigProvider</code> interface and telling Sooda to use it.
                        The interface has only one method: <code>string GetString(string)</code> which must read a configuration
                        setting with the specified name. The setting name is of the form <code>dataSourceName.parameterName</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To register your configuration provider in a declarative manner, you can either use an assembly-level attribute 
                        or an application configuration file entry. Assuming you have created a class <code>MyProvider</code> 
                        that implements <code>ISoodaConfigProvider</code>
                        interface, just add the following code to your <code>AssemblyInfo.cs</code>:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#">
                        using Sooda;

                        [assembly: SoodaConfig(ProviderType=typeof(MyNamespace.MyProvider))]
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        If you prefer to use the application configuration file, add the <code>sooda.config</code> entry containing
                        the fully qualified name of the type (including assembly name, version and public key token).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To register the config provider programmatically, just call <code>SoodaConfig.SetConfigProvider()</code>

                                        below <code>QueryTimeTraceInfo</code> (floating point time in seconds), log output is emitted at the lowest possible
                                        level (<code>Trace</code>). If the query execution time is between <code>QueryTimeTraceInfo</code>
                                        and <code>QueryTimeTraceWarn</code>, the query is logged at the <code>Info</code> level. Queries
                                        which take more than <code>QueryTimeTraceWarn</code> seconds to execute are logged at the <code>Warn</code>
                                        level.

                                        The default value of <code>QueryTimeTraceWarn</code> is 10 seconds 
                                        and <code>QueryTimeTraceInfo</code> defaults to 2 seconds. 
                                        The following configuration settings set the Info threshold to 0.5 seconds and Warn 
                                        threshold to one second.

            <body>
                <p>
                    Each database-backed object in Sooda is associated with a transaction represented by 
                    an instance of SoodaTransaction class. Transactions provide database connection management,
                    identity management (ensuring reference-level object identity as mentioned <sectionlink id="primarykeys" />).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to support identity management, transactions implement an L1 cache of all alive objects. SoodaTransaction
                    is able to return a cached object given the <code>(className,primaryKeyValue)</code> pair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No object can live outside the transaction and object state is not defined after the transaction
                    has been closed. Keeping a transaction open for a longer period of time is not recommended because it consumes
                    unmanaged resources, such as database connections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Transactions need to be closed when they are no longer needed and if you fail to ensure that, otherwise
                    you may get all sorts of unmanaged resource leaks. Typical usage pattern for a Sooda transaction 
                    that ensures the transaction is properly closed is presented below. It makes use of the
                    IDisposable pattern and the C# using() statement:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    using (SoodaTransaction t = new SoodaTransaction())
                    {
                        // perform operations on Sooda objects here
                        t.Commit();
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    In order to support long-running transactions, Sooda supports a <a href="#serialization">differential
                        serialization mechanism</a>, which lets you persist uncommitted changes made within transaction to an XML document, 
                    and deserialize them later, perhaps in a different process or a different machine.

                    <p>
                        Instances of <code>SoodaTransaction</code> must be created before any operation
                        on O/R-mapped objects. You need to properly close the transaction after you are
                        done with the objects. The best way to ensure that your transaction is closed
                        regardless of any exceptions that may occur is to use the <code>IDisposable</code> 
                        pattern and C# <code>using()</code> statement:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#">
                        using (SoodaTransaction t = new SoodaTransaction())
                        {
                            // perform operations on Sooda objects here

                        Transactions need to be explicitly committed to properly save all changes made to objects.
                        If you fail to do so, the transaction is rolled back by default.

                    <p>
                        Each transaction must be associated with a mapping schema which is embedded as a resource into the 
                        compiled DAL assembly. You need to configure the transaction to use the appropriate assembly. 
                        There are several ways to do it depending on how you are planning to use your DAL:

                        As mentioned earlier, every object which inherits from <code>SoodaObject</code> must be associated with an instance
                        of <code>SoodaTransaction</code>. There are three ways to materialize objects which will be discussed in further sections:

                    <p>
                        All these methods need a transaction object. It would be inconvenient
                        to require the transaction reference to be passed explicitly, therefore Sooda supports the concept of 
                        implicit active transaction (returned by the <code>SoodaTransaction.ActiveTransaction</code> static property).
                        Implicit transaction is used when no explicit transaction is specified.

                        SoodaStubGen generates all APIs in two versions: one that takes <code>SoodaTransaction</code> object as 
                        parameter and the other that assumes implicit transaction.

                        When you create a new <code>SoodaTransaction</code> object it is automatically 
                        stored in <code>SoodaTransaction.ActiveTransaction</code> unless you
                        pass <code>SoodaTransactionOptions.NoImplicit</code> argument to the constructor. 
                        The property is restored to its previous value when the transaction is closed/disposed,

            <body>
                <p>
                    To create a new persistent object in Sooda you simply invoke its constructor, optionally passing the transaction
                    reference. There are 3 constructors generated by Sooda:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>default constructor - takes no arguments and associates newly created object with the implicit transaction</li>
                    <li>constructor which takes <code>SoodaTransaction</code> as an argument - associates newly created object with the specific transaction</li>
                    <li>special constructor which takes <code>SoodaConstructor</code> as an argument - this 
                       constructor should never be called by the user code and is used internally by Sooda</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                   Typical code to create an object, set its properties and save to the database is:
               </p>
               <code lang="C#">
                   using (SoodaTransaction t = new SoodaTransaction())
                   {
                        // create new object

                        Person p = new Person();

                        // set properties
                        p.Name = "Nancy Newcomer";
                        p.Sex = "F";
                        p.Address = "1 Microsoft Way";
                        p.ZipCode = "98052";
                        p.City = "Redmond";
                        p.State = "WA";
                        p.BirthDate = new DateTime(1980, 1, 1);

                        // commit
                        t.Commit();
                   }
               </code>
               <p>
                   Sooda allows you to create more than one object in the transaction and will properly handle situations where
                   two newly created objects are dependent on one another. SQL <code>INSERT</code> operations
                   will be properly ordered when <code>Commit()</code> is called, to ensure that all foreign
                   key constraints are preserved.
                   The following example demonstrates this:

                        // We want to make this transactional

                        Customer c = new Customer();
                        Order o = new Order();
                        OrderItem i1 = new OrderItem();
                        OrderItem i2 = new OrderItem();

                    There are various ways to load objects from the database depending on the desired result:

                    <p>
                        Sooda provides two ways to get a reference to an object given its primary key:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>ClassName.GetRef()</code> - gets a reference to an object without loading its data</li>
                        <li><code>ClassName.Load()</code> - gets a reference to an object and loads its data</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Lazy loading is a way to get a reference to the object without actually loading data from the
                        database. Property values will be loaded on first read access. Getting object reference is very fast
                        and should be used when we do not need actual object data, just its reference, as 
                        described <sectionlink id="lazyloading" />.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following example demonstrates basic concepts of lazy loading:

                    <p>
                        Reference fields use <code>GetRef()</code> internally so that when you access a property that returns another object
                        this object usually starts in the <code>Data Not Loaded</code> state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that it is not always possible to provide a reference to an object without loading its data, so GetRef() 
                        may sometimes need to load the data. When you invoke <code>GetRef()</code> or <code>Load()</code> on an
                        object of class that has subclasses, Sooda needs to load a record from the database to check the concrete type
                        to instantiate. Fortunately Sooda has a Factory Cache mechanism to avoid loading
                        records more than once as described <sectionlink id="factorycache" />.

                        Sooda uses a <a href="#soql">query language called SOQL</a> to select
                        objects that meet the specific criteria. To get a list of matching objects you 
                        use the <code>GetList()</code> method. 
                        To load a single object by SOQL query use <code>LoadSingleObject()</code>.

                        <code>GetList()</code> method is overloaded to support various usage scenarios.
                        The most complex variant of the method takes five parameters, but <a href="#soodastubgen">SoodaStubGen</a>

                        <li><code>NoTransaction</code> - Do not apply changes made in transaction. Use this option to perform a 
                            database snapshot or when you are sure that none of transaction objects will affect the result. 
                            This helps speed things up a bit.</li>
                        <li><code>NoWriteObjects</code> - Do not precommit objects. Precommit is described <sectionlink id="precommit" />.</li>
                        <li><code>VerifyAfterLoad</code> - Verify after load. In case of a precommit it is possible that the result
                            list will include extra objects. Enabling this option causes the resulting objects to be re-evaluated
                            in memory</li>
                        <li><code>KeysOnly</code> - Load only the primary key values. Objects will be materialized but fields other than primary keys will require a database query.</li>
                        <li><code>Cache</code> - Fetch collection items from cache if possible.</li>
                        <li><code>NoCache</code> - Do not load the collection from cache even if it would be possible to do so</li>
                        <li><code>PrefetchRelated</code> - Use prefetch definition from the schema to load related objects automatically</li>

                        The most commonly used option here is <code>NoWriteObjects</code> which can be used to disable precommit. 
                        This example demonstrates passing this option to <code>GetList()</code>. Passing SoodaSnapshotOptions.NoWriteObjects
                        causes "<code>Nancy Newcomer</code>" not to be included in the list of returned objects. If we omitted this flag,
                        Sooda would <a href="#precommit">precommit</a> <code>newPerson</code> object by making the SQL <code>INSERT</code> and Nancy Newcomer would be

                    Sooda guarantees reference identity for objects retrieved from a database. It means
                    that if we make 2 or more queries which retrieve a particular row from the 
                    database in the same <a href="#soodatransaction">transaction</a>
                    they are guaranteed to be mapped to the same object (not just two objects that are equal).
                    It means that you can modify the object through either any of the references and 
                    you will be modifying the same object, so the state is going to be consistent.
                    Mechanism that ensures object identity is called Level 1 (transaction-level) caching.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following example demonstrates multiple ways to acquire references to objects 
                    and the identity assertions that Sooda guarantees:

                <p>
                    There are methods and properties of the <code>SoodaTransaction</code> class that let you to control
                    the object cache mechanism:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>UseWeakReferences</code> property - enables weak references to be used for L1 cache management. Setting this property to <code>true</code>
                        causes Sooda to keep track of <b>unmodified</b> objects in transactions using weak references. This makes them
                        subject to be garbage-collected when the memory is low. 
                        Modified (dirty) objects are always registered using strong references.
                        Because unmodified objects can always be retrieved from the database, this approach is useful
                        when you are dealing with a large number of read-only objects that are cheap to reload from the database.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>DirtyObjects</code> property - returns a collection of dirty objects (objects modified within
                        the transaction)</li>
                    <li><code>DeletedObjects</code> property - returns a collection of objects marked for delete</li>
                    <li><code>FindObjectWithKey(className,keyValue,expectedType)</code> method -&#160;returns a cached object whose class name 
                        is <code>className</code> and primary key is <code>keyValue</code>. If the object is not found in L1 cache or if the object
                        is not of <code>expectedType</code>, this function returns <code>null</code>.</li>
                    <li><code>GetObject(className,keyValueString)</code> method - gets a reference to the object of the specified class
                        and primary key. The primary key is given as a string, so this method is best suited for scripting/web environment
                        where the primary key can be passed in a URL. This method does not pre-load object data
                        into memory, that is it is equivalent to <code>ClassName.GetRef(keyValue)</code> method.</li>
                    <li><code>LoadObject(className,keyValueString)</code> method - same as <code>GetObject(className,keyValueString)</code> 
                        but preloads object data into memory. It is an equivalent of the <code>ClassName.Load(keyValue)</code> method.</li>
                    <li><code>GetNewObject(className)</code> - creates a new object of specified class. It is same as
                        creating a new instance of the object by calling the constructor and passing current transaction as an argument.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Transactions in Sooda are meant to be short-lived, because each SoodaTransaction manages
                    one or more open database connections which should be short-lived.
                    It is not recommended to keep the database connections open for a longer period of time because 
                    it might negatively impact system scalability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are cases when long-lived transactions are desired, such as in a web application that
                    gathers user input from many web pages, makes incremental changes to the database and commits the transaction
                    once at the very end of the process. Sooda provides differential serialization
                    mechanism that allows you to capture the state of an open transaction and store it in an XML document.
                    This XML document can be persisted to some medium (such as a file, buffer in memory, ASP.NET Session 
                    state or ViewState) and restored in a new transaction later. 
                    The transaction can be restored in another thread, process, or even on another machine, as long as the target 
                    environment has access to the original database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The API for serialization and deserialization is very simple. It consists of methods named <code>Serialize()</code> and 
                    <code>Deserialize()</code> respectively. The serialization code is presented below:

                    To deserialize the transaction in a new environment, just use the <code>Deserialize()</code> method:

                    The XML returned by the <code>Serialize()</code> method should be treated as opaque (you should not assume
                    anything about its structure), but is generally human-readable. Sample transaction dump is presented below:

                    Stub classes generated by <a href="#soodastubgen">SoodaStubGen utility</a> are derived from
                    <code>SoodaObject</code> which provides some common methods and infrastructure for storing
                    object data, caching, lazy loading, <a href="#triggers">triggers</a> and more. 
                    This section describes public API exposed by 
                    <code>SoodaObject</code> class. More details are available in the source code comments.

                <p>
                    <code>SoodaObject</code> exposes no public properties, only methods. All properties
                    visible from outside of the object are generated by <a href="#soodastubgen">SoodaStubGen</a>. 
                    Public methods of <code>SoodaObject</code> are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>bool AreFieldUpdateTriggersEnabled()</code> - returns a value indicating whether field 
                        update triggers (<code>BeforeFieldUpdate</code> and <code>AfterFieldUpdate</code>) are enabled.
                        More information about field update triggers can be found <sectionlink id="triggers" />.</li>
                    <li><code>bool EnableFieldUpdateTriggers()</code> - enables field update triggers and returns a boolean value indicating their state before enabling</li>
                    <li><code>bool DisableFieldUpdateTriggers()</code> - disables field update triggers and returns a boolean value indicating their state before disabling</li>
                    <li><code>bool EnableFieldUpdateTriggers(bool flag)</code> - enables or disables field update triggers based on the boolean flag. This function returns the previous state of triggers. 
                        <p>
                            An ordinary pattern for disabling field update triggers for some region of code is presented below.
                        </p>

                        <code lang="C#">

                        </code>

                    </li>
                    <li><code>void ForcePostCommit()</code> - forces the postcommit trigger (<code>AfterObjectUpdate()</code>) to be called even if there are no changes to object's internal state</li>
                    <li><code>bool IsInsertMode()</code> - returns a value indicating whether the object is in insert mode (that is, it has been created in the transaction). Note that it does not indicate
                        that object has not been inserted into the database yet, because of possible <a href="#precommit">precommit</a>.</li>
                    <li><code>SoodaTransaction GetTransaction()</code> - returns a reference to the transaction that manages this object.</li>
                    <li><code>void MarkForDelete()</code> - marks the object for deletion and executes any cascade deletes on all objects that reference this object. 
                        Sooda issues SQL DELETE statement as soon as objects are marked for deletion, 
                        but since the transaction is not committed until the very end, this operation can be reversed. 
                        Deleting objects immediately helps Sooda detect any foreign key constraint violations.</li>
                    <li><code>bool IsMarkedForDelete()</code> - returns a value indicating whether the object has been marked for deletion.</li>
                    <li><code>bool IsFieldDirty(fieldNumber)</code> - returns a value indicating whether the specified field (indicated by its ordinal) is dirty.</li>
                    <li><code>bool SetFieldDirty(fieldNumber,dirty)</code> - sets or clears the specified field's dirty flag, which causes it to be saved to the database on commit. 
                        Sooda normally manages the dirty flag automatically, but you might want to override it in certain situation. Use with caution.</li>
                    <li><code>bool IsObjectDirty()</code> - returns a value indicating whether the object has been modified in the transaction. Note that resetting field statuses back to non-dirty does not automatically make the object non-dirty. 
                        Only <code>Commit()</code> or <code>Rollback()</code> clears this flag.</li>
                    <li><code>ClassInfo GetClassInfo()</code> - gets the <code>ClassInfo</code> object that include the schema-level metadata about the class. More information about <code>ClassInfo</code> is available <sectionlink id="schemaapi" />.</li>
                    <li><code>string GetObjectKeyString()</code> - returns a unique string that includes object's primary key. The string is of the form <code>"ClassName[PrimaryKeyValue]"</code>, for example <code>"Person[10]"</code> 
                        or <code>"Employee[1234]"</code>.</li>
                    <li><code>object GetPrimaryKeyValue()</code> - returns a primary key of the object. For scalar (single-columns) primary keys actual values (integer or string) are returned, for multi-column primary keys this function 
                        returns an instance of the <code>SoodaTuple</code> class.</li>
                    <li><code>object Evaluate(SoqlExpression expression[, bool throwOnError])</code> - evaluates the <a href="#soql">SOQL expression</a> in memory and returns its value. <code>throwOnError</code> causes 
                        the function to either throw exception or return <code>null</code> on error (such as null reference exception).</li>
                    <li><code>string GetLabel()</code> - evaluates the label property and returns its string value. The name of the label 
                        property is defined with the <a href="#schemaclasses"><x><class label="..." /></x> declaration</a> in the schema file.</li>

                    <li>object is updated</li>

                <p>
                    There are two variants of each trigger: "before" trigger and "after" trigger. Triggers are methods declared 
                    in the <code>SoodaObject</code> class 
                    that can be overridden in skeleton classes generated by the <a href="#soodastubgen">SoodaStubGen utility</a>.
                    Overriding a "before" trigger allows you to prevent some operation (such as field modification) from happening
                    while "after" triggers are called after the operation has been already performed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They object-level triggers have canonical names:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>void BeforeObjectInsert()</code> - fires immediately before an object is inserted into the database</li>
                    <li><code>void AfterObjectInsert()</code> - fires after all objects have been inserted into the database and committed, once for each object.</li>
                    <li><code>void AfterObjectUpdate()</code> - fires immediately before an object is updated</li>
                    <li><code>void AfterObjectDelete()</code> - fires after all objects have been updated and committed, once for each object.</li>
                    <li><code>void BeforeObjectDelete()</code> - fires immediately before the object is deleted</li>
                    <li><code>void AfterObjectDelete()</code> - fires after the object has been deleted and committed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The field-level trigger methods are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>void BeforeFieldUpdate(string fieldName, object oldValue, object newValue)</code> - fires immediately before any of the fields is updated</li>
                    <li><code>void AfterFieldUpdate(string fieldName, object oldValue, object newValue)</code> - fires immediately after any the fields has been modified</li>
                    <li><code>void BeforeFieldUpdate_FieldName(object oldValue, object newValue)</code> - fires immediately before field FieldName is modified</li>
                    <li><code>void AfterFieldUpdate_FieldName(object oldValue, object newValue)</code> - fires immediately after field FieldName has been modified</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To prevent the field update from happening, you need to override the "before" trigger method and throw an exception from it. 
                    The following example demonstrates overriding the triggers:

                Object-level triggers are always available and cannot be disabled. You can disable field-level triggers 
                (BeforeFieldUpdate_xxx and AfterFieldUpdate_xxx) either at stub generation stage or at runtime.
                The former option is useful to reduce the amount of generated code, because stub classes can get pretty large 
                when you declare many fields in a class.

                Note that Sooda does not generate triggers for primary key fields. That is because they are immutable - you cannot the 
                value of a primary key once it has been set, as it would break the rules of reference identity. It would lead to a situation
                where two different objects would have the same primary key values which is forbidden.

            <title>Key Generation</title>
            <body>
                <p>
                    Key generation is a process of generating unique identifiers to be used for primary keys of newly created objects.
                    Because primary keys must be known before objects can be committed, <b>you cannot use SQL Server identity columns</b> for key
                    generation. By default Sooda uses a table-based key generator that manages primary keys by storing their values in
                    a special database table, but you can write your own generator by creating a class that implements 
                    the <code>IPrimaryKeyGenerator</code> interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Table-based primary key generation uses a database table (called <code>KeyGen</code> by default) 
                    with 2 columns: <code>key_name</code> and <code>key_value</code> which store class name and
                    next primary key value to be generated respectively:
                </p>
                <img src="doc16.gif" />
                <p>
                    Because keys are stored in the database table, generating them requires two SQL statements to be executed. One is SELECT to
                    fetch the current value of the primary key, the other one is to update the database table so that next 
                    generation will not use the same value again. Because of this cost, Sooda allocates keys in batches of ten (the number is
                    configurable) so it only needs to make 2 round-trips to the server for every ten new keys generated.
                </p>
                <code lang="SQL">
                    -- fetch current value of the primary key
                    SELECT @kv = key_value FROM KeyGen where key_name = 'ClassName';

                    -- update KeyGen table with the new possible primary key
                    UPDATE KeyGen
                    SET key_value = @kv + 10
                    WHERE key_name = 'ClassName' AND key_value = @kv 
                </code>
                <p>
                    This algorithm is multi-process safe, so multiple processes can create new objects concurrently, 
                    but it does not guarantee that the primary keys of newly created objects will be monotonously increasing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can configure the name of the table and batch size on a per-datasource basis 
                    by using the configuration parameters:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code><b>datasourcename</b>.keygentable.name</code> - name of the keygen table (by default (<code>KeyGen</code>)</li>
                    <li><code><b>datasourcename</b>.keygentable.keycolumn</code> - name of the columns that holds key names (by default <code>key_name</code>)</li>
                    <li><code><b>datasourcename</b>.keygentable.valuecolumn</code> - name of the columns that holds values (by default <code>key_value</code>)</li>
                    <li><code><b>datasourcename</b>.keygentable.pool_size</code> - the number of keys to allocate at one (by default <code>10</code>)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The following example demonstrates using application configuration file to override default name
                    of the KeyGen table and names of its columns.

            <title>Precommitting objects in transactions</title>
            <body>
                <p>
                    Sooda supports the <code>GetList()</code> method to get the list of objects matching the specified criteria. It is not possible
                    to calculate the list in memory because it would be very inefficient, therefore the criteria written in SOQL 
                    (textual or typed) are converted to SQL and executed by the database engine. 
                    Objects in transaction can be modified, created and deleted and RDBMS needs to be notified of all
                    such modifications or it will return an outdated list of matching objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider this example:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    using (SoodaTransaction t = new SoodaTransaction())
                    {
                        // create new person object but don't commit it

                        Person p = new Person();
                        p.Name = "Nancy Newcomer";

                        // now get a list of all persons

                        PersonList pl = Person.GetList(true);
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    The condition <code>true</code> passed to the <code>GetList()</code> method is always met, so you expect 
                    it to return all objects of class <code>Person</code> including the newly created 'Nancy Newcomer' object. 
                    <code>GetList()</code> ultimately results in an SQL query, whose result should
                    include the mentioned object. For this reason, Sooda needs to issue an <code>INSERT INTO Person</code> statement
                    before executing the <code>SELECT</code> statement on the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, Sooda ensures that any modifications made in transaction, which can affect the query results,
                    are saved to the database before the query is executed. Objects that need to be precommitted are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>all objects of the queried class (<code>Person</code> in the above example) and its subclasses</li>
                    <li>all objects of classes mentioned in the <code>WHERE</code> clause and their subclasses</li>
                    <li>all uncommitted, dependent objects of the above which are in insert mode</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For example, the following code causes all objects of <code>Person</code>, 
                    <code>Group</code> and <code>OrganizationUnit</code> classes to be precommitted because they are mentioned
                    in the <code>WHERE</code> clause
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    <![CDATA[
                    using (SoodaTransaction t = new SoodaTransaction())
                    {
                        Person p;

                        Person.GetList(PersonField.Name == "Mary Manager" 
                                    && PersonField.Group.Name == "Managers" 
                                    && PersonField.OrgUnit.Name == "Sales Department");
                    }
                    ]]>
                </code>
                <p>
                    To disable precommit, you need to pass the <code>SoodaSnapshotOptions.NoWriteObjects</code> option 
                    to the <code>GetList()</code> method. To manually cause a precommit at any time, you can 
                    invoke the <code>SoodaTransaction.SaveObjectChanges()</code> method.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that if your query contains a <code>RAWQUERY()</code> clause, determining the list of
                    objects to be precommitted may not be possible, so all objects are precommitted to ensure consistent 
                    results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Precommitting objects can become difficult if we have non-nullable fields in the database and
                    data for these fields has not been provided yet (this is only possible when the object is in insert mode). 
                    When inserting such objects, Sooda needs to provide SOME value for the column, otherwise the insert will fail.
                    You can specify what values should be written to the database for each column type, referenced table or you can
                    set them on a per-field basis as described <sectionlink id="schemaprecommitvalues" />.
                    It is important to specify correct precommit values for all referenced tables if you 
                    use foreign key constraints in the database. If you do not specify the precommit values, Sooda will insert 
                    the default value of zero into foreign key columns which may violate the constraints.

            <title>Caching</title>
            <body>
                <p>
                    Sooda supports two caching levels:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>transaction identity cache</b> - also called Level 1 cache, whose primary goal is to ensure object referential identity</li>
                    <li><b>Level 2 Cache</b> - which optimizes database access by caching results of SQL queries that read single objects and collections</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    First level of cache is totally transparent to the user, while the second level of cache is configurable
                    and may need to be tuned for the best performance. There are two aspects of the cache mechanism that are tunable:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>caching policy</li>
                    <li>cache storage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Caching policy determines what objects should be stored in cache and how long they are kept there. 
                    There are many possible approaches here:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>none</b> - do not use Level 2 cache</li>
                    <li><b>all</b> - all objects are subject to be cached - useful for small databases (up to 1 GB)</li>
                    <li><b>small</b> - cache small cardinality objects, large and medium cardinality objects are always reloaded from the database</li>
                    <li><b>smallmedium</b> - cache small and medium cardinality objects, large cardinality objects are always reloaded from the database</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Objects are considered <code>Small</code>, <code>Medium</code> or <code>Large</code> depending on the
                    <code>cardinality</code> setting in the <a href="#schema">mapping schema</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to this, you can also create your own caching policy by creating a class that implements 
                    the <code>ISoodaCachingPolicy</code> interface. Your caching policy can use caching hints (<code>cached</code>, 
                    <code>cacheCollections</code>, <code>cardinality</code> as defined in the schema) or your algorithm to decide
                    which objects or collections should be put into cache.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To configure the caching policy for your application, just set the <code>sooda.cachingPolicy</code> key in the
                    <a href="#configuration">configuration file</a> to one of the predefined policy names or use the name
                    of your own class which implements the <code>ISoodaCachingPolicy</code>. To configure expiration timeout and
                    sliding expiration use <code>sooda.cachingPolicy.expirationTimeout</code> (timeout in seconds) and 
                    <code>sooda.cachingPolicy.slidingExpiration</code> (boolean <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) respectively. 
                    The following example configures caching of small and medium objects, with the expiration timeout of one 
                    hour and sliding expiration set to true:
                </p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <configuration>
                        <appSettings>
                            <!-- cache small and medium objects -->
                            <add key="sooda.cachingPolicy" value="smallmedium" />

                            <!-- retain objects for 3600 seconds - one hour -->

                            <!-- each access to an object resets the one-hour timeout -->
                            <add key="sooda.cachingPolicy.slidingExpiration" value="true" />
                        </appSettings>

                    ]]>
                </code>
                <p>
                    Alternatively you can configure caching in code, by setting the static property called <code>CachingPolicy</code>
                    of the <code>SoodaCache</code> class:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    // cache small and medium objects
                    SoodaCacheSmallAndMediumPolicy policy = new SoodaCacheSmallAndMediumPolicy();

                    // retain objects for one hour
                    policy.ExpirationTimeout = TimeSpan.FromHours(1);

                    // each access to an object resets the one-hour timeout
                    policy.SlidingExpiration = true;

                    // make the caching policy active for new transactions
                    SoodaCache.DefaultCachingPolicy = policy;
                </code>
                <p>
                    Newly created transactions default to the caching policy stored in <code>SoodaCache.DefaultCachingPolicy</code>, but
                    you can override it for each transaction separately. To disable caching for a particular transaction, use this code:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    <![CDATA[
                    using (SoodaTransaction t = new SoodaTransaction())
                    {
                        // don't use caching in this transaction
                        t.CachingPolicy = new SoodaNoCachingPolicy();
                    }
                    ]]>
                </code>
                <p>
                    In addition to various caching policies, Sooda supports pluggable storage engines. By default Sooda comes with two:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>inprocess</b> - default - in-process LRU cache</li>
                    <li><b>none</b> - no caching</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can implement other cache storage mechanism by creating a class that 
                    implements the <code>ISoodaCache</code> interface. It should be possible to integrate with commercial
                    cache engines through this interface for great scalability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To configure cache storage mechanism, just set the <code>sooda.cache</code> parameter in in the configuration file to
                    one of the mentioned caching implementations. You can also specify a fully qualified name of the class that implements
                    <code>ISoodaCache</code> interface:
                </p>
                <code lang="XML">
                    <![CDATA[
                    <configuration>
                        <appSettings>
                            <add key="sooda.cache" value="MySuperCache.SoodaCachingProvider, MySuperCache, PublicKeyToken=..., Version=..." />
                        </appSettings>
                    </configuration>
                    ]]>
                </code>
                <p>
                    You can achieve the same thing in code, by setting the <code>DefaultCache</code> 
                    property of the <code>SoodaCache</code> class:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    MySuperCache.SoodaCachingProvider cache = MySuperCache.SoodaCachingProvider();

                    // configure 'cache' here - set some hypothetical properties
                    cache.Size = 1000000;
                    cache.Location = "c:\\mycache";
                    
                    // make the cache active for new transactions
                    SoodaCache.DefaultCache = cache;
                </code>
                <p>
                    As with the caching policies, you can also override the cache mechanism on a per-transaction basis:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    <![CDATA[

                        // override default cache storage for this transaction
                        t.Cache = cache;
                    }

            <title>Working with Data Sources</title>
            <body>
                <p>
                    Sooda supports pluggable data sources. In theory it should be possible to implement support backends 
                    other than relational databases, but current version of Sooda only supports SQL Data sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SQL Data source provides a way to programmatically execute SOQL queries against relational databases. It is 
                    also used internally by Sooda to provide low-level mapping functionality such as loading single
                    objects, collections and saving changes back to the database.
                    It currently supports the following RDBMSes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>mssql</code> - Microsoft SQL Server 2000, 2005, MSDE and SQL Server Express</li>
                    <li><code>postgresql</code> - PostgreSQL 8.x and higher</li>
                    <li><code>oracle</code> - Oracle 8i and higher</li>
                    <li><code>mysql4</code> - MySQL 4.x and higher</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    SQL Data Source is implemented in <code>Sooda.Sql.SqlDataSource</code> class. 
                    To use it in the <a href="#schema">mapping schema</a>, declare a <x><datasource /></x> with a type
                    of <code>Sooda.Sql.SqlDataSource</code>:
                </p>
                <code lang="XML">
                    <![CDATA[
                    <schema xmlns="http://www.sooda.org/schemas/SoodaSchema.xsd">
                        <datasource name="db" type="Sooda.Sql.SqlDataSource" />
                    </schema>
                    ]]>
                </code>
                <p>
                    Note that at this point, you do not specify the database connection type, connection string or SQL
                    dialect - these things are configured at runtime, so that applications can run unmodified with
                    a database engine of choice. Data source runtime configuration is explained 
                    <sectionlink id="configuringdatasources" />.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two ways to acquire a <code>SqlDataSource</code> object, depending on whether you
                    have an open transaction. If you do, getting the SQL data source is a matter of calling <code>OpenDataSource()</code>
                    method on a <code>SoodaTransaction</code> instance, passing the name of the data source to open.
                    SoodaTransaction manages a list of open data sources and will return the same data source object when <code>OpenDataSource()</code> 
                    is called with the same data source name twice.
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    using (SoodaTransaction t = new SoodaTransaction())
                    {
                        // get a reference to open datasource
                        SqlDataSource ds = (SqlDataSource)t.OpenDataSource("default");

                        // you do not need to (and should not) close the data source 
                        // explicitly it will be closed when the transaction terminates.
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    If you are not within the context of a transaction or you want to create a 
                    detached <code>SqlDataSource</code> object, create a new object with <code>new</code>
                    passing the data source name as an argument to the constructor. To make sure that the SQL Data Source 
                    is properly closed, it is best to use the C# <code>using()</code> statement:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    using (SqlDataSource ds = new SqlDataSource("default"))
                    {
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    Before you can use the <code>SqlDataSource</code> object, you need to initialize its properties.
                    If you pass the name of the datasource in the constructor invocation, default values for
                    the properties are read automatically from the configuration file as 
                    described <sectionlink id="configuringdatasources" />. Once the properties have been initialized,
                    you should call the <code>Open()</code> method to connect to the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following methods and properties of the <code>SqlDataSource</code> class can be invoked from user code:
                </p>
                <ul>

            <p>
                Sooda supports a query language named SOQL which is similar to SQL (Structured Query Language)
                enhanced with path expressions, collections, named constants and inheritance support. Only SELECT operation is 
                supported which means no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE support exists in SOQL.
            </p>
        </body>
        <section id="soqltext">
            <title>SOQL Queries</title>
            <body>
                <p>
                    SOQL queries have syntax similar to SQL SELECT statements. Each query has the following form:
                </p>
                <code lang="SQL">
                    SELECT     [TOP number] [DISTINCT] select_expressions
                    FROM       from_expressions
                    [WHERE     boolean_expression]
                    [GROUP BY  groupby_expressions]
                    [HAVING    boolean_expression]
                    [ORDER BY  sort_expressions]
                </code>
                <p>
                    SOQL queries are based on classes and fields as opposed to tables and columns. You should use names defined in the <a href="#schema">mapping schema</a> 
                    with <x><class name="..." /></x> and <x><field name="..." /></x>. Let's assume you have the following class definition that
                    maps table <code>ctct</code> to class <code>Contact</code> and uses field names different from column names:
                </p>
                <code lang="XML">
                    <![CDATA[
                    <class name="Contact">
                        <table name="ctct">
                            <field name="ID" dbcolumn="contact_id" type="Integer" primaryKey="true" />
                            <field name="Name" dbcolumn="contact_name" type="String" size="40" />
                        </table>
                    </class>
                    ]]>
                </code>
                <p>
                    You can write the following SOQL statement that gets the name of some particular contact:
                </p>
                <code lang="SQL">
                    select Name
                    from   Contact
                    where  ID=123
                </code>
                <p>
                    It is equivalent to the following SQL query:
                </p>
                <code lang="SQL">
                    select contact_name
                    from   ctct
                    where  contact_id = 123
                </code>
                <p>
                    SQL-like query from multiple classes with JOIN specified in the where clause is supported but rarely needed
                    because Sooda supports <a href="#soqlpathexpressions">path expressions</a> which greatly
                    simplify query code. There are other useful extensions to SQL, as described <sectionlink id="soqllanguageelements" />.

                <p>
                    SOQL supports the following language constructs known from SQL:

                <ul>
                    <li>relational operators (<code>=</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>LIKE</code>)</li>
                    <li>boolean operators (<code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>)</li>
                    <li><code>EXISTS()</code>, <code>IN()</code>, <code>IS NULL</code> and <code>IS NOT NULL</code> predicates</li>
                    <li>arithmetic operators (<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>,<code>*</code>,<code>/</code> and <code>%</code>) with natural precedence and associativity</li>
                    <li>arithmetic (<code>-</code>) and boolean (<code>NOT</code>) negation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    SOQL is case-insensitive on keywords, class names and property names. 
                    For readability, it is recommended to use the original casing when 
                    referring to fields and classes. Case sensitivity of string comparisons and SOQL <code>LIKE</code> operator are  database-dependent.

                        without JOIN operators. To access a property of a related object you simply prefix the name of the property
                        with the path of dot-separated property names that leads to the object. Path length is unlimited.

                        Sooda supports one-to-many and many-to-many collections in queries. SOQL queries 
                        can get the size of a collection as well as check if a particular 
                        object is contained in the collection. The following operations are supported:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>collection.Count</code> - get the size of a collection</li>
                        <li><code>collection.Contains(object)</code> - check whether a particular object is included in the collection</li>
                        <li><code>collection.Contains(ClassName where condition)</code> - check whether any object from the collection matches the specified condition</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        To get the number of elements in the collection, just append the <code>.Count</code> after the collection name:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="SQL">
                        -- select all contacts that have more than one role

                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Using <code>Count</code> is supported in select expressions, not just in the WHERE clause:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To check if a given collection contains a particular object, use the <code>Contains(object)</code>. 
                        The <code>object</code> can be a value of a object field, a named constant or a literal value (an integer or a string):
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The same condition can be specified by using the value of <code>1</code> (the primary key) instead of <code>Contact.Mary</code>.

                        You can see that <code>Count</code> and <code>Contains()</code> are 
                        quite powerful constructs that let you write simple and complex queries without
                        the use of explicit joins. Join-free SOQL queries can be translated to SQL

                        SOQL provides a convenient notation for specifying subqueries that are used as arguments to <code>EXISTS()</code> and <code>Contains()</code>
                        <code>SELECT id FROM class WHERE condition</code> can be shortened to <code>Class WHERE condition</code>. Thus the following two
                        SOQL queries are equivalent:

                    Raw queries can be used to take advantage of RDBMS-specific SQL constructs, such as full-text-search, custom
                    operators and built-in functions. Raw queries are passed unmodified by the <a href="#soqltosqlconversion">SOQL to SQL Conversion</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To write a raw query, simply use <code>RAWQUERY(text)</code>. The <code>text</code> can be any SQL, but you
                        must be careful to correctly balance parenthesis. <code>RAWQUERY()</code> may also be a potential security risk
                        if you pass unvalidated user input as raw queries.
                    </p>
                    <code lang="SQL">

                        Raw queries may include translated field and class names. You can escape back to SOQL by using the <code>SOQL{{...}}</code>
                        notation:

                    SOQL expressions can be used to filter objects returned by the <code>GetList()</code> or 
                    <code>LoadSingleObject()</code> methods. You simply pass the <code>WHERE</code> clause as a string 
                    argument to the constructor of the <code>SoodaWhereClause</code> class and pass the 
                    constructed where clause object to the appropriate method. You cannot specify a list of columns here, <code>GetList()</code> 
                    and <code>LoadSingleObject()</code> always operate on objects.
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    ContactList cl;

                    // get the list of contacts whose names start with 'Mary'
                    cl = Contact.GetList(new SoodaWhereClause("Name like 'Mary%'"));

                <p>
                    Manually concatenating string literals can be dangerous and lead 
                    to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">cross-site scripting vulnerabilities</a> in web applications.
                    Fortunately Sooda lets you separate string literals from the rest of the query code.
                    You can use the <code>{0}, {1}, {2}</code> notation similar to <code>Console.WriteLine()</code>.
                    Note that you do not need to quote the strings yourself nor surround <code>{0}</code> with apostrophes. In fact
                    this would cause the '{0}' string to be treated literally and not as a parameter reference.

                <p>
                    Textual queries passed to <code>SoodaWhereClause</code> have one deficiency: property/field names
                    that you use are not validated at compilation time. It is possible to write code that contains
                    references to non-existing fields. The compilation will succeed, but you will get runtime
                    errors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When developing large systems that change often (such as workflow applications with
                    ever-changing customer requirements) it may be beneficial to statically validate all queries used in 
                    the application to make sure that you only reference correct fields. This way, when you remove a field
                    from the schema or change its type, the application will simply not compile and the compiler will show
                    you statements that need to be corrected because of the original change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sooda implements typed SOQL queries, which let you write SOQL-like expressions in pure C# using a technique
                    called operator overloading. Sooda comes with a large set of classes that represent nodes in query expression
                    trees (such as relational operators, path expressions, <code>Count</code>, <code>Contains</code>, boolean <code>and</code>, 
                    <code>or</code>, <code>not</code> and so on).
                    These classes overload standard C# operators such as <code>+</code>,<code>-</code>,<code>&amp;&amp;</code>,
                    <code>||</code> so that they return elements of the syntax tree instead of performing actual computations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To properly support path expressions, some schema-specific code needs to be generated as well 
                    which <a href="#soodastubgen">SoodaStubGen utility</a> takes care of. It generates a set of 
                    classes that let you build typed path expressions and typed collection expression builders. They both
                    let you express almost all SOQL features. In some rare cases (such as SQL functions or subqueries)
                    you can resort to text-based SOQL and even combine the two approaches in a single query.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typed queries are very concise, because you do not need to wrap them with strings or use
                    any special objects (such as <code>SoodaWhereClause</code>) that will parse them. You do not need
                    to use any form of string escaping and because there is no parsing involved whatsoever you can be
                    sure that the code is cross-site-scripting-safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following table compares features of typed queries and text-based SOQL. The syntax for typed queries
                    and operator precedence is based on the C# language. Note that other languages that support 
                    operator overloading may use different notation and/or different operator precedence.

                                    the name of the class the expression applies to. For example:

            <body>
                <p>
                    Sooda now supports LINQ, which has become the standard query language in .NET 3.5.
                    LINQ has all the benefits of Typed Queries, which existed in Sooda before LINQ appeared.
                    It is recommended that you use LINQ for all new code.
                    Typed Queries remain in Sooda for backward compatibility.

                    <p>
                        Each Sooda class contains a method called <code>Linq()</code>
                        which is the root of all LINQ queries.
                        If not followed by LINQ methods, <code>Linq()</code> returns all objects of the given class:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#">
                        foreach (Contact c in Contact.Linq())
                            Console.WriteLine(c.Name);
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        The <code>Linq()</code> method is overloaded and you can pass a <code>SoodaTransaction</code>
                        and <a href="#loadingbyquery">SoodaSnapshotOptions</a> to it:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#">
                        foreach (Contact c in Contact.Linq(SoodaSnapshotOptions.NoWriteObjects))
                            Console.WriteLine(c.Name);
                    </code>
                    <code lang="C#">
                        foreach (Contact c in Contact.Linq(transaction, SoodaSnapshotOptions.Default))
                            Console.WriteLine(c.Name);
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        LINQ methods described below become available on the result of <code>Linq()</code>
                        as you import the <code>System.Linq</code> namespace
                        (note <code>System.Linq</code> and not <code>Sooda.Linq</code>).
                        This is necessary for all LINQ queries except for the trivial cases such as the above.

                <title>LINQ queries</title>
                <body>
                    <p>
                        There are two ways of writing LINQ queries: method calls and LINQ keywords.
                        These two are equivalent: the C#/VB.NET compiler translates LINQ keywords to method calls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's start with method calls. Most LINQ methods accept <i>lambda expressions</i>
                        where the only parameter is the so called <i>range variable</i>.
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
                        Contact.Linq().Where(c => c.Name == "Mary Manager");
                    ]]></code>
                    <p>
                        In the above code, the <code>Where()</code> method is called with the lambda expression
                        <code><![CDATA[c => c.Name == "Mary Manager"]]></code>.
                        In this expression, <code>c</code> is the range variable and
                        <code>c.Name == "Mary Manager"</code> is the <i>body</i> of the lambda expression.
                        This code is equivalent to:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#">
                        Contact.GetList(ContactField.Name == "Mary Manager");
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        The body of the lambda expression is specified in C#.
                        Therefore you get the advantages of compile-time type checking which can detect
                        errors such as misspelled property names and type mismatch
                        (e.g. comparing an integer field to a string).
                        However, you need to be aware that this code gets translated to SQL
                        and executed by the database engine. If you use a construct that cannot be
                        translated to SQL, you will get a <b>runtime</b> error.
                        Therefore you must write lambda expressions carefully.
                        <a href="#linqexpressions">A section below</a> lists the supported constructs.
                        When in doubt, always test your code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>Where()</code> method that we saw in the example is used to filter rows,
                        just like SQL <code>WHERE</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To sort results, use <code>OrderBy()</code> and <code>OrderByDescending()</code>:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
                        Contact.Linq().OrderBy(c => c.Name);
                        Contact.Linq().OrderByDescending(c => c.ContactId);
                    ]]></code>
                    <p>
                        If you chain <code>OrderBy()</code> calls, they will be executed in order:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
                        Contact.Linq().OrderByDescending(c => c.ContactId).OrderBy(c => c.Name);
                    ]]></code>
                    <p>
                        Here, the list is first sorted by <code>ContactId</code> and then sorted again by <code>Name</code>.
                        The result is that <code>Name</code> has priority for ordering.
                        To write multiple order expressions as you are used to,
                        use <code>ThenBy()</code> and <code>ThenByDescending()</code>:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
                        Contact.Linq().OrderBy(c => c.Name).ThenByDescending(c => c.ContactId);
                        // same result as in the previous example
                    ]]></code>
                    <p>
                        Or, using LINQ keywords (more about them later):
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#">
                        from c in Contact.Linq()
                        orderby c.Name, c.ContactId descending
                        select c;
                        // ditto
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        <code>Select()</code> can be used to transform Sooda objects into any .NET object you want:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
                        Contact.Linq().Select(c => c.Name);
                        Contact.Linq().Select(c => new { Id = c.ContactId, Name = c.Name);
                    ]]></code>
                    <p>
                        Unlike other LINQ methods, Sooda's <code>Select()</code> doesn't get translated to SQL,
                        but is executed on the .NET side. This means that you may use any valid .NET code
                        in the <code>Select()</code> lambda expression.
                        The downside is that even if you query for a single column, such as <code>Name</code>,
                        all columns are fetched from the database and Sooda objects are materialized.
                        This might change in future versions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To limit the number of rows, use <code>Take()</code>:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
                        Contact.Linq().OrderBy(c => c.Name).Take(2);
                    ]]></code>
                    <p>
                        <code>Take()</code> corresponds to SQL Server's <code>TOP</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are syntax extensions to C# and VB.NET that make LINQ queries
                        look like SQL queries:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
                        from c in Contact.Linq()
                        where c.Active && c != Contact.Mary
                        orderby c.LastSalary.Value descending, c.Name
                        select c.ContactId;
                    ]]></code>
                    <p>
                        <code>from</code> must come first, and <code>select</code> must come last.
                        The C# compiler will replace the above query with method calls:
                    </p>
                    <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
                        Contact.Linq()
                        .Where(c => c.Active && c != Contact.Mary)
                        .OrderByDescending(c => c.LastSalary.Value).ThenBy(c => c.Name)
                        .Select(c => c.ContactId);
                    ]]></code>
                    <p>
                        There are LINQ keywords for some, but not all LINQ methods.
                        Sooda supports:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>from ... in ...</code> - doesn't correspond to any method,
                            but merely introduces a LINQ source and a range variable</li>
                        <li><code>where</code> - corresponds to <code>Where()</code></li>
                        <li><code>orderby</code>, <code>ascending</code> (default), <code>descending</code>
                            - correspond to <code>OrderBy()</code>, <code>OrderByDescending()</code>,
                        <code>ThenBy()</code>, <code>ThenByDescending()</code></li>
                        <li><code>select</code> - corresponds to <code>Select()</code>,
                            except when given just the range variable
                            (<code>select</code> is mandatory in the LINQ keyword syntax)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Sooda doesn't support <code>join ... in ... on ... equals ...</code>,
                        <code>group ... by ...</code>, <code>into</code> nor <code>let</code> LINQ keywords.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These were the most commonly used LINQ query methods.
                        The methods below might be useful especially when you build queries dynamically.

                        As a rule of thumb, if you need to iterate LINQ query results more than once,
                        you should materialize the results to a collection and then iterate over this collection.
                        The most efficient way is calling <code>ToList()</code> to get a generic list.
                        Alternatively you may call <code>ToArray()</code>:

                    <p>
                        Using LINQ with Sooda lists, such as <code>ContactList</code>, is discouraged.
                        However you may need them for interoperability with legacy code.
                        To convert LINQ query results to a Sooda list, import <code>Sooda.Linq</code>
                        (in addition to the usual <code>System.Linq</code>), call <code>ToSoodaObjectList()</code>
                        and pass the result to a Sooda list constructor:

                    <p>
                        This technique is not limited to LINQ.
                        You may use <code>ToSoodaObjectList()</code> to convert any generic collections,
                        such as <code><![CDATA[List<Contact>]]></code>, to Sooda lists.

                        Logical operators are: &amp;&amp;, || and !.
                        On numbers you may use arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, % (modulo) and unary negation (-).

                        SoodaStubGen utility is responsible for generating stub code for a Data Access Layer. The generated code needs
                        to be compiled with the rest of the application code as described <sectionlink id="compilationprocess" />.

                        You usually invoke SoodaStubGen as part of your automated build process to ensure that the 
                        <a href="#generatedcode">generated code</a> is in sync with the <a href="#schema">mapping schema</a>.

                            SoodaCompileStubs utility can be used to precompile generated stubs into a separate DLL.
                            Separate stub compilation is an advanced feature of Sooda and should be used with caution as described <sectionlink id="compilationprocessseparate" />. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The utility is located in the same directory as <a href="#soodastubgenlocation">SoodaStubGen</a>.
                            It is a commmand-line program (no GUI is provided) that is meant to be part of an automated build
                            process. You should run it after SoodaStubGen to automatically compile stub code generated by it.
                        </p>

                            The usage is:

                        <code lang="C#">

                            <li><code>assembly_base_name</code> - is the base name of the output assembly.
                                SoodaCompileStubs will generate <code>assembly_base_name.Stubs.dll</code> that contains stubs for
                                skeleton classes contained in <code>assembly_base_name.dll</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li><code>stubs_dir</code> - is the path to the generated <code>Stubs</code> directory. The directory contains the following files:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>_DBSchema.bin</li>

                                </ul>
                                This set of files is generated automatically by SoodaStubGen when <x><stubs-compiled-separately /></x> parameter is set to <code>true</code>
                                or when <code>--separate-stubs</code> command line option is passed to it.

                                <code>extra_files</code> - is a list of additional source files to be compiled with the skeleton classes.
                                The files should be written in C# and they should include the same assembly-level attributes as
                                <code>assembly_base_name.dll</code> will have. It is recommended to reuse the same <code>AssemblyInfo.cs</code>
                                file for separate stub compilation and normal compilation of <code>assembly_base_name.dll</code>.

                        <p>
                            Assuming your output DAL assembly is DAL.dll and the source files are located in the <code>DAL</code> directory,
                            typical command line options to generate DAL.Stubs.dll are:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="C#">
                            SoodaCompileStubs DAL source\DAL\Stubs source\DAL\AssemblyInfo.cs
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            When compiling the DAL.dll you should reference <code>source\DAL\Stubs\DAL.Stubs.dll</code>. It is important to
                            not to remove the <code>source\DAL\Stubs\DAL.dll</code> file as it is necessary for compilation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SoodaCompileStubs checks modification dates on source files in the Stubs directory and recompiles the output only
                            if the files are newer than the resulting DLL or if the DLL does not exist.

                    <body>
                        <p>
                            There are situations where you need to synchronize the contents of the <a href="#keygeneration"><code>KeyGen</code> table</a>
                            to match actual primary key values. Do this after running any SQL script that inserts new rows
                            into mapped tables. If you fail to synchronize the <code>KeyGen</code> table, Sooda will generate non-unique primary
                            keys which will cause primary key constraints to be violated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, assume that the <code>KeyGen</code> table contains a record where key_name="Foo" and key_value="100".
                            You now run an SQL script that inserts new records into <code>Foo</code> table:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="SQL">
                            insert into Foo(id,...) values (101,...);
                            insert into Foo(id,...) values (102,...);
                            insert into Foo(id,...) values (103,...);
                            insert into Foo(id,...) values (104,...);
                            ...
                            insert into Foo(id,...) values (999,...);
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            After you do this, you need to update the appropriate KeyGen record to have key_value = 1000, because this is the next
                            value that should be generated for the primary key. If you fail to do so, newly created objects will get IDs of 100, 101, 102
                            which are invalid.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SoodaFixKeygen is a command-line utility that reads a <a href="#schema">mapping schema</a> file and generates an SQL
                            script to properly update the KeyGen table. The SQL is written to the specified file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Usage is:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="C#">
                            SoodaFixKeygen soodaschema.xml outputFile.sql
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            After running the command, <code>outputFile.sql</code> will contain statements similar to:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="SQL">
        delete from KeyGen;
        insert into KeyGen
        select 'Role',coalesce(max(id),0) + 1 from _Role
        union
        select 'Contact',coalesce(max(id),0) + 1 from Contact
        union
        select 'Group',coalesce(max(id),0) + 1 from _Group
        union
        select 'Vehicle',coalesce(max(id),0) + 1 from Vehicle

        select 'Car',coalesce(max(id),0) + 1 from Vehicle
        union
        select 'Bike',coalesce(max(id),0) + 1 from Vehicle
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            In order to properly update the KeyGen table, you should run the generated SQL code using 
                            SQL Query Analyzer or any other SQL client utility. Note that the SQL generated is specific to SQL Server, 
                            other databases may require some post-processing.

            <body>
                <p>
                    Logging in Sooda can be used to trace Sooda components such as transaction management, caching, 
                    data sources and SOQL to SQL conversion. Having a trace file in place can be useful for 
                    post-execution analysis of your program and to understand the inner workings of Sooda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following logging mechanisms are supported:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>console</code> - write all log messages to the console</li>
                    <li><code>null</code> - no log messages are written</li>
                    <li><code>nlog</code> - use <a href="http://www.nlog-project.org/">NLog</a> to manage logs</li>
                    <li><code>log4net</code> - use <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net">log4net</a> to manage logs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To configure logging, add the <code>sooda.logging</code> entry to the appropriate configuration file, an application configuration file:
                </p>
                <code lang="XML">

                </code>
                <p>
                    or a shared XML configuration file:
                </p>
                <code lang="XML">
                    <![CDATA[

                <p>
                    To enable logging in code, you need to set the static <code>Implementation</code> property
                    of the <code>Sooda.Logging.LogManager</code> class to an instance of appropriate logging implementation class.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>ConsoleLoggingImplementation</code> - for console logging</li>
                    <li><code>NullLoggingImplementation</code> - for no logging</li>
                    <li><code>NLogLoggingImplementation</code> - for logging with NLog</li>
                    <li><code>Log4NetLoggingImplementation</code> - for logging with log4net</li>
                </ul>
                <code lang="C#">
                    using Sooda.Logging;

                    class Program
                    {
                        static void Main(string[] args)
                        {
                            // turn on console logging
                            LogManager.Implementation = new ConsoleLoggingImplementation();
                        }
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    When using NLog or Log4Net you need to provide additional configuration files. Refer to 
                    the documentation of the product in question for more information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To write your own logging provider, you need to create a class that implements the 
                    <code>Sooda.Logging.ILoggingImplementation</code>  interface defined by Sooda and 
                    put the fully qualified name of the class in <code>sooda.logging</code> configuration setting:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each logging message in Sooda is associated with a source that identifies the component that emitted the log.
                    When using NLog or log4net, you can use the source to filter log messages. When console logging is used, there is no
                    way to specify which messages are emitted so it is recommended to use one of the mentioned log routing packages
                    or disable logging entirely, because emitting large amounts of tracing information can severely slow down the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following sources are defined:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>Sooda.Cache</code> - Level-2 caching related messages</li>
                    <li><code>Sooda.Config</code> - configuration-related messages</li>
                    <li><code>Sooda.FactoryCache</code> - factory cache messages</li>
                    <li><code>Sooda.ListSnapshot</code> - GetList()-related messages</li>
                    <li><code>Sooda.ManyToManyCollection</code> - many-to-many collections support</li>
                    <li><code>Sooda.OneToManyCollection</code> - one-to-many collections support</li>
                    <li><code>Sooda.Object</code> - per-object diagnostics messages (lazy loading, caching)</li>
                    <li><code>Sooda.Transaction</code> - transaction management</li>
                    <li><code>Sooda.SqlDataSource</code> - messages specific to SQL data source</li>
                    <li><code>Sooda.SQL</code> - SQL queries sent down to the RDBMS</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Most logging messages are emitted with the lowest severity available (<code>Trace</code> for NLog, 
                    <code>Debug</code> for log4net), but Sooda also uses the <code>Error</code> and <code>Warning</code>
                    severities as necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically you should keep detailed logging disabled, with the possible exception of tracing SQL queries
                    emitted through <code>Sooda.SQL</code> and increase log level to diagnose and fix bugs in your code 
                    or Sooda code. Error and warning messages should never be filtered out.

            <title>SOQL to SQL Conversion</title>
            <body>
                <p>
                    Relational databases do not understand Sooda schemas nor SOQL language, 
                    therefore a translation from SOQL to SQL is necessary before any query can be executed.
                    Sooda comes with a <code>SoqlToSqlConverter</code> class that does the necessary translation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result of the conversion is dependent on the <a href="#schema">mapping schema</a>, because SOQL to SQL converter 
                    must translate classes to database table names and named constants to literals. As database engines implement
                    slightly different SQL dialects, you must also pass
                    an instance of an SQL builder class that implements <code>ISqlBuilder</code> interface and abstracts the SQL dialect
                    detail. Sooda comes with the following SQL builders for the most popular databases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>SqlServerBuilder</code> - Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005</li>
                    <li><code>OracleBuilder</code> - Oracle 8i and above</li>
                    <li><code>MySqlBuilder</code> - MySQL 4.x and above</li>
                    <li><code>PostgreSqlBuilder</code> - PostgreSQL 7.3 and above</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By default Sooda does the SOQL to SQL conversion automatically for all GetList-based queries.
                    <a href="#sqldatasource">Data Source</a> classes provide methods that can be used to issue
                    SOQL queries on a database. 
                    There are situations where you might want to do the conversion by hand, for example when you
                    need to modify/instrument the result of conversion before executing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start the conversion, you need to pass the tree representation of your SOQL query, 
                    namely a <code>SoqlQueryExpression</code> object, obtained it by calling <code>SoqlParser.ParseQuery()</code>.
                    SoqlToSqlConverter writes the result of conversion to the specified <code>TextWriter</code> object - you can use an 
                    instance of the <code>StringWriter</code> class to store the result in a string variable.
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    string soqlQueryText = "soql query";
                    SchemaInfo schemaInfo; // parsed schema

                    // SQL-Server specific SQL Builder object
                    ISqlBuilder builder = new SqlServerBuilder();

                    // parse the query
                    SoqlQueryExpression query = SoqlParser.ParseQuery(soqlQueryText);

                    // create a StringWriter to write the results to
                    StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();

                    // create an instance of converter
                    SoqlToSqlConverter converter = new SoqlToSqlConverter(sw, schemaInfo, builder);

                    // set various options
                    converter.IndentOutput = this.IndentQueries;
                    converter.GenerateColumnAliases = false;
                    converter.ConvertQuery(queryExpression);

                    // put the results in a string
                    string sqlText = sw.ToString();
                </code>
                <p>
                    The following sections provide an overview of the SOQL to SQL conversion process. 
                    Knowing the SQL that is generated from various SOQL constructs may be
                    useful to fully understand the cost of some Sooda features, but it is not
                    generally needed for normal use of Sooda.

                        During conversion, each path expression prefix gets a unique table alias and appropriate joins

                    <p>
                        The number of joins required is always equal to the number of dots in the path expression. 
                        SOQL to SQL converter is smart enough to use the minimal number of joins when you reuse path expression prefixes. 
                        Consider a query that finds all contacts who belong to groups managed by 'Mary Manager' or whose

                        The result of SOQL to SQL conversion of collection operators depends 
                        on the type of collection and the operation used. There are 3 possible operations on collections:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>Count</code></li>
                        <li><code>Contains(obj)</code> - where obj is an object</li>
                        <li><code>Contains(subquery)</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The following sections demonstrate the result of SOQL to SQL conversion for 
                        <a href="#soqltosqlconversioncollections1N">one-to-many</a> and 
                        <a href="#soqltosqlconversioncollectionsMN">many-to-many</a> collections.

                        <p>
                            Operations on one-to-many collections (such as <code>Group.Members</code> where each person may belong to one group),
                            are translated to subqueries on the "child" table (<code>Contact</code> in this example).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <code>Count</code> operation gets converted to a subquery containing the <code>select count(*)</code> expression.
                            Consider this query:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="SQL">
        select  * 
        from    Group
        where   Members.Count > 3
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            It translates to:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="SQL">
        select   t0.id as [Id],
                 t0.manager as [Manager],
                 t0.name as [Name]
        from     _Group t0
        where    ((select count(*) from Contact where primary_group=t0.id) > 3)
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            Converting <code>Contains()</code> on one-to-many collections is easy, because the expression 
                            <code>parentObject.collection.Contains(childObject)</code> can be translated to
                            <code>childObject.ReferenceField = parentObject</code>, so this query:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="SQL">
        select * 
        from			Group
        where	 Members.Contains(Contact.Mary)
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            translates to
                        </p>
                        <code lang="SQL">
        select   t0.id as [Id],
                 t0.manager as [Manager],
                 t0.name as [Name]
        from     _Group t0
        where    exists (select * from Contact where primary_group=t0.id and id in (1))
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            As you can see <code>Contains()</code> has
                            been translated to SQL <code>EXISTS()</code> clause. Note that <code>Contact.Mary</code> has been replaced with <code>1</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>Contains(subquery)</code> translates to similar <code>EXISTS()</code> expression with numeric literals replaced
                            with the translated subquery. SOQL code:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="SQL">
        select * 
        from     Group
        where	 Members.Contains(Contact where Name like 'Mary%')
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            And the resulting SQL query is:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="SQL">
        select   t0.id as [Id],

            where    (t1.name like 'Mary%')))
                        </code>

                        <p>
                            Operations on many-to-many collections (such as <code>Contact.Roles</code> where each contact may hold many roles and
                            a role can be held by many persons), are translated to subqueries on the resolving table 
                            (declared with the <x><relation /></x> element in the <a href="#schema">mapping schema</a>).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <code>Count</code> operation gets converted to ta subquery containing the <code>select count(*)</code> expression.
                            Consider this query:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="SQL">
        select  * 
        from    Contact
        where   Roles.Count > 3
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            It translates to the following SQL:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="SQL">
    select   t0.id as [ContactId],

             t0.name as [Name],
             t0.active as [Active],
             t0.last_salary as [LastSalary]
    from     Contact t0

                        </code>
                        <p>
                            Translating <code>Contains()</code> that operates on single objects is only slightly more complicated 
                            than in the one-to-many case. It gets converted to an SQL <code>EXISTS()</code> clause,
                            but it requires additional expression to join back to the "parent" table:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given this SQOL:
                        </p>
                        <code lang="SQL">

                            <code>SoodaClass</code> returns class name as a string. In cases where the class is known statically (when the class
                            is known to have no subclasses), it is emitted directly into the SQL output. When the class has
                            subclasses, Sooda needs to resort to runtime evaluation using SQL <code>CASE ... WHEN ... END</code>
                            construct.

                        <p>

                            Is equivalent to the following SQL, because class <code>Contact</code> does not have any subclasses.

                            subclasses. The additional where clause always includes the identifiers of all concrete types that 
                            may be returned. If we wanted to limit ourselves to the bikes, we cold have written:

                        Each <x><class /></x> element defined in the <a href="#schema">mapping schema</a> is represented 
                        in generated code by two classes: skeleton and stub. Stub classes typically inherit from the <code>SoodaObject</code>
                        class, but when Sooda class inheritance is used, the stub classes may inherit from parent skeleton classes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to this, you may "inject" your own class into the inheritance hierarchy at two levels:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>by specifying the <x><base-class-name /></x> in the <a href="#soodaproject">Sooda Project File</a></li>
                        <li>by overriding the base class name in the schema with the <code>extBaseClassName</code> attribute.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The class you inject must provide 2 constructors required by Sooda and must ultimately derive from <code>SoodaObject</code>.
                        Typical declaration of the injectable class looks like this:

                        SoodaStubGen generates one property for each <x><field /></x> declared in the mapping schema. The
                        name of the property is taken from the <code>name</code> attribute and the property type 
                        depends on two factors:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the nullability of the field</li>
                        <li>the primitive representation as defined in the Sooda Project File</li>

                    <p>
                        If the field is nullable, SoodaStubGen uses the representation passed in <x><nullable-representation /></x> parameter.
                        If the field is not nullable, the representation passed in <x><not-null-representation /></x> is used. 
                        Particular representations are presented in the following sections.

                      Thanks to factory classes, Sooda can create instances of materialized objects without using reflection, which helps
                      speed things up.

                        You typically acquire a reference to the <code>SchemaInfo</code> object that matches the compiled

                        The <code>_DatabaseSchema</code> class is generated by the <a href="#soodastubgen">SoodaStubGen utility</a> and
                        so the namespace depends on your <a href="soodaproject">code generation settings</a>.

                        this class contains one item, which is a table <code>TA</code> containing the
                        <code>Id</code>, <code>F1</code> and <code>F2</code>, because both <x><table /></x>s that define them are 
                        based on the same database table. The <code>UnifiedTables</code> contents are the same as <code>LocalTables</code>

            <title>Factory Cache</title>
            <body>
                <p>
                    Factory cache is a mechanism that is meant to optimize the <code>GetRef()</code> operation for classes
                    that are part of inheritance relationships. For all other cases <code>GetRef()</code> can be very cheap, 
                    constant-time operation, but if a class has subclasses, Sooda needs to issue a database query to
                    determine the concrete class that should be instantiated. Once the query has been executed and the concrete
                    class is known, we can cache it so that further <code>GetRef()s</code> can be done without any database queries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default Sooda comes with eternal factory cache that stores the primary key to concrete class association in 
                    a hashtable that is never emptied. This is sufficient for most databases with less than a few million records. For
                    larger databases you should implement your own factory cache by creating a class that implements the <code>ISoodaObjectFactoryCache</code>
                    interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have defined your own factory cache, you should assign it to the static 
                    property <code>SoodaObjectFactoryCache</code> of the <code>SoodaTransaction</code> class:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    SoodaTransaction.SoodaObjectFactoryCache = new MyFactoryCache();
                </code>

        <section id="activetransactionmanagement">
            <title>ActiveTransaction management</title>
            <body>
                <p>
                    Implicit transaction (stored in <code>SoodaTransaction.ActiveTransaction</code>) is kept in 
                    thread's local storage (TLS). It means that as long as you access the objects from the thread
                    that created the transaction, you do not need to pass the transaction reference explicitly.
                    There are situations where storing the transaction on per-thread basis is not feasible. For example
                    events in the ASP.NET environment are not guaranteed to be thread-bound so you cannot store
                    implicit <code>SoodaTransaction</code> in TLS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, Sooda supports multiple strategies for managing the implicit transaction reference.
                    There are three predefined strategies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>SoodaThreadBoundTransactionStrategy</code> - default thread-bound implementation</li>
                    <li><code>SoodaHttpContextBoundTransactionStrategy</code> - ASP.NET HttpContext-bound implementation</li>
                    <li><code>SoodaProcessBoundTransactionStrategy</code> - process-bound implementation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To change the active strategy, create an instance of the appropriate strategy class and assign 
                    it to the <code>SoodaTransaction.DefaultTransactionStrategy</code> static property:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    SoodaTransaction.DefaultTransactionStrategy = new SoodaHttpContextBoundTransactionStrategy();
                </code>
                <p>
                    To implement your own strategy, create a class that implements the 
                    <code>IDefaultSoodaTransactionStrategy</code> interface. Two methods need to be implemented: one that
                    gets current transaction and the other that sets it and returns a previous value.

            <title>Prefetching</title>
            <body>
                <p>
                    Prefetching is a technique that allows object references to be pre-loaded from the database 
                    at the same time the object is loaded. This is possible thanks to the SQL <code>OUTER JOIN</code>
                    operators. Normally Sooda issues a simple SQL statement to load an object from the database::
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    select column1, column2, ..., columnN
                    from   table1
                    where  id=123
                </code>
                <p>
                    Assuming that <code>columnR</code> is a foreign key reference to <code>table2</code>, we can load two
                    objects in a single query by using an outer join:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    select t1.column1, t1.column2, ..., t1.columnN
                           t2.column1, t2.column2, ..., t2.columnM
                    from   table1 t1
                           left outer join table2 t2 on (t1.columnR = t2.id)
                    where  t1.id=123
                </code>
                <p>
                    Note that columns 1..N belong to objects stored in "<code>table1</code>" and 
                    columns N+1..N+M are from "<code>table2</code>".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sooda extends this concept with the possibility to include arbitrary number of objects being prefetched
                    on each load. This can be controlled by the <code>prefetch</code> attribute of the <x><field /></x> element in the
                    <a href="#schema">mapping schema</a>. By default it is zero, meaning that no prefetch should be performed,
                    but you can set it to a higher value to indicate level of objects that should be prefetched.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Without the prefetch, Sooda would have to issue the SQL query to retrieve each Employee object separately.
                    Assuming you have 10 levels of management in your company, that would be 10 SQL queries. To minimize the number of queries, you can add prefetch="3"

                <p>
                    When you load an <code>Employee</code> object <code>e</code>, Sooda preloads the following referenced objects, so you can access 
                    their properties without an SQL query:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    e.Manager
                    e.Manager.Manager
                    e.Manager.Manager.Manager
                </code>
                <p>
                    Once you access <code>e.Manager.Manager.Manager.Manager</code>, Sooda will preload:
                </p>
                <code lang="C#">
                    e.Manager.Manager.Manager.Manager.Manager
                    e.Manager.Manager.Manager.Manager.Manager.Manager
                    e.Manager.Manager.Manager.Manager.Manager.Manager.Manager
                </code>
                <p>
                    If there are at most three managers in the hierarchy, setting the <code>prefetch</code> to <code>3</code> ensures that
                    the entire structure will be fetched in a single SQL query. 
                    The cost of prefetch is usually very small, but the number of columns returned in a query grows as you 
                    prefetch, so you should limit the depth of the prefetch operation. Prefetch value of one is usually sufficient.
